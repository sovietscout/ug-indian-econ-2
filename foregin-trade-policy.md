### **6. Mention the primary objectives of the foreign trade Policy, (FTP) 2023. Appraise the key features of FTP, 2023. Give a brief review of the regional and preferential trade agreements of India since 2015. (3+4+3)**

**(a) Primary Objectives of FTP 2023 (3 marks):**
Based on Singh (2023), the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023 has several stated and implicit objectives:
1. **Ambitious Export Target:** The headline objective is to achieve $2 trillion in exports (merchandise and services combined) by the year 2030, aiming to significantly transform India economically.
2. **Policy Continuity and Responsiveness:** The policy aims to provide continuity from the previous framework while establishing itself as a dynamic, "ever-evolving" document responsive to the changing geo-economic environment and feedback from the trade community, without a fixed "sunset clause."
3. **Stimulating Exports and Facilitating Imports:** Consistent with the general purpose of any FTP, it aims to stimulate India's exports while facilitating necessary imports, although the article critiques the *effectiveness* of its promotional aspects.
4. **Enhancing Ease of Doing Business:** A major thrust, reflected in various features, is to simplify processes and improve the ease of doing business for actors involved in international trade.

**(b) Key Features of FTP 2023 (4 marks):**
Singh (2023) identifies several key features of the FTP 2023:
1. **Shift from Incentives to Tax Remission:** The policy marks a definitive move away from direct export incentive schemes like MEIS and SEIS (which faced WTO challenges and were phased out/abolished) towards WTO-compliant tax remission mechanisms like the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme, aimed at refunding unrebated taxes embedded in the export chain.
2. **Focus on Digital Governance and Trade Facilitation:** There is a strong emphasis on leveraging technology for automation, process re-engineering, and reducing transaction time. This includes automating approvals (e.g., EODC for duty neutralisation schemes), introducing an electronic portal for cross-border e-commerce, implementing electronic Certificates of Origin (e-CO) with self-certification options, and liberalising rules for merchanting trade transactions (MTTs).
3. **Promotion of E-commerce Exports:** Specific focus is given to facilitating e-commerce exports, including increasing the value limit for such exports eligible for FTP benefits (to â‚¹10 lakh) and developing dedicated portals to ease customs and logistics.
4. **Districts as Export Hubs (DEH):** The policy introduces the DEH initiative, aiming to identify and promote products with export potential at the district level, involving local stakeholders and artisans to "democratise" export promotion.
5. **Streamlining SCOMET Policy:** Procedures for exporting sensitive Special Chemicals, Organisms, Materials, Equipment, and Technologies (SCOMET) or dual-use items are being streamlined, including plans for a digital system for general authorisations, to facilitate exports in high-end goods like defence and technology.
6. **Dynamic and Evolving Framework:** Unlike previous fixed five-year policies, FTP 2023 is presented as a dynamic document intended to be updated continuously based on evolving needs and feedback, without a defined end date.

**(c) Review of Regional and Preferential Trade Agreements Since 2015 (3 marks):**
Singh (2023) offers a critical perspective on India's recent FTA strategy within the context of FTP 2023. While the article analyses existing FTAs (Table 5), its commentary relevant to the post-2015 period highlights:
1. **Limited New Agreements:** The article implicitly contrasts the current situation with the past, suggesting a slowdown in signing new comprehensive agreements compared to the pre-2014 era (a point made explicitly in the Subramanian and Felman article referenced elsewhere). It doesn't list multiple new FTAs signed since 2015. Most crucially, it withdrew from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership due to concerns over trade imbalances, particularly with China.
2. **Focus on India-UAE CEPA:** The most notable recent agreement discussed positively is the India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), 2022. Singh (2023, p. 53) identifies this as the "only consumption-driven FTA India has ever signed." The article notes its success ("ever-escalating exports") and strategic value in leveraging the UAE as a gateway to West Asia and Africa.
3. **Critique of Partner Choice:** The article critiques India's historical FTA strategy (much of which predates 2015 but remains relevant) for focusing on agreements with countries that are strong production hubs but not necessarily large consumption markets for Indian goods (e.g., Singapore, South Korea, Japan, ASEAN). This suggests a potential strategic shift exemplified by the UAE agreement, though the overall pace of new, effective agreements seems limited according to the broader context provided.

### **7. Discuss the dimensions of FTP, 2023. Examine the relevance of these dimensions in context of the ambitious export target of $2 trillion by 2023. Do you think that the FTP, 2023 is up to the expectations of the trade community in India? Justify your answer. (4+3+3)**

**(a) Dimensions of FTP 2023 (4 marks):**
Singh (2023), particularly through the chapter-wise analysis in Table 3 (p. 52), outlines the key dimensions or thematic areas covered by FTP 2023:
1. **Legal Framework and Trade Facilitation:** Establishing the overarching rules, focusing on simplifying procedures and enhancing the ease of doing business through digitalization and process re-engineering.
2. **General Import/Export Provisions:** Covering the standard regulatory aspects and procedures governing cross-border trade.
3. **District-Level Export Promotion (DEH):** A new dimension focused on identifying and nurturing export potential from districts, aiming for geographical diversification and inclusion.
4. **Tax Neutralisation:** Implementing schemes (Duty Exemption/Remission like RoDTEP, EPCG) to ensure that taxes embedded in export production are remitted or neutralized, aiming to enhance cost competitiveness.
5. **Export-Oriented Zones:** Maintaining provisions for specific zones like EOUs, EHTPs, STPs, BTPs, although their relevance is questioned by the author due to alternative schemes like MOOWR.
6. **E-commerce Promotion:** A dedicated focus on facilitating cross-border trade through digital platforms, particularly for MSMEs.
7. **Regulation of Dual-Use Items (SCOMET):** Streamlining the policy framework for the export of sensitive goods and technologies.
8. **Quality Standards and Dispute Resolution:** Addressing aspects related to maintaining quality compliance and managing trade disputes.
9. **Support for Deemed Exports:** Provisions related to transactions classified as 'deemed exports'.

**(b) Relevance of Dimensions to the $2 Trillion Target (3 marks):**
Singh (2023) critically examines the relevance of these dimensions for achieving the ambitious $2 trillion export target by 2030:
* **Tax Neutralisation Schemes (Chapters 4, 5):** While essential for maintaining a level playing field, these are seen as standard global practice ("globally accepted convention") and thus are "not supposed to transform India's export ecosystem for competitive leapfrogging" (Singh, 2023, p. 51). They prevent disadvantage but do not confer a significant new advantage.
* **Districts as Export Hubs (DEH):** This is viewed as an inclusive, democratizing initiative but unlikely to significantly contribute to the massive target because its product identification is based on existing local capacities rather than rigorously analysed international market demand (Singh, 2023, p. 51).
* **Export Enclaves (EOUs etc.):** Considered largely "irrelevant" in the context of the more simplified MOOWR scheme (Singh, 2023, p. 51).
* **Trade Facilitation & Digitalisation:** While positive steps towards efficiency, the article implies these are necessary groundwork but insufficient on their own to drive the required exponential growth. The focus is more on administration than strategic market creation.
* **E-commerce:** Seen as potentially beneficial for MSMEs, but the policy lacks sufficient detail on building the necessary supporting ecosystem (e.g., large platforms, return logistics, warehousing) required for it to scale significantly (Singh, 2023, p. 51-53).
Overall, the article suggests that the current dimensions, while containing useful elements, are heavily weighted towards facilitation and regulation rather than the aggressive, demand-driven, strategic export promotion needed for the $2 trillion goal.

**(c) Is FTP 2023 Up to Expectations? (3 marks):**
No, according to Singh (2023), the FTP 2023 has **remained below the expectations** of the trade community in India.
**Justification:**
* **Compilation, Not Innovation:** The article repeatedly argues that FTP 2023 is largely a "compilation of existing schemes in a new version" (p. 50) and lacks genuinely new, transformative policies aimed at aggressive export promotion.
* **Bureaucratic Lens:** It critiques the policy for adopting a "top-down approach from a bureaucratic lens" rather than being designed from an "exporting firm's perspective" addressing their core challenges and needs first-hand (p. 52).
* **Missing Key Promotional Elements:** The policy is found wanting in crucial areas considered essential for export promotion, such as developing robust market information & intelligence systems, strategic product-market identification based on global demand, a coherent FTA strategy focused on consumption markets, comprehensive guidance on navigating trade instruments (NTBs, etc.), and adequate support for product innovation and professional skill development for exporters (p. 52-54).
* **Focus on Regulation/Facilitation:** While facilitation is important, the policy's primary focus seems to be on regulation and administrative simplification, rather than the strategic interventions needed for "trade promotion, expansion, diversification, identification of new products, services and markets, scaling up production capacities and competence, cutting costs, and improving the export competitions" required to meet the $2 trillion target (p. 54).
