### **8. Give an outline of the structure of financial institutions and financial markets in present India. Briefly discuss the journey of banking sector. Name a few numbers of Development Finance Institutions operating in India during 70s and 80’s. Why are they defunct during the liberalised era in India? (5+5)**

**(a) Structure of Financial Institutions and Markets (Approx. 5 marks):**
Based on Mohan and Ray (2017), the structure of the Indian financial sector as of the mid-2010s can be outlined as follows:
**Financial Institutions:**
*   **Banks:**
    * Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks)
    * Co-operative Banks
    * Newer Differentiated Banks (Payments Banks & Small Finance Banks - recent entrants)
*   **Non-banks:**
    * Development Banks (largely wound up by this period)
    * Insurance Companies
    * Mutual Funds
    * Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)
    * Others (e.g., Pension Funds, Primary Dealers)

**Financial Markets (as depicted in Figure 2):**
* **Money Market:** Segmented into Overnight (Call Money) and Up to One Year (Collateralized Borrowing and Lending Obligations - CBLO, Market Repo, Treasury Bills - T-bills).
* **Credit Market:** (Not explicitly detailed in Figure 2 but discussed in the text concerning bank lending).
* **Bond Market:** Comprising Government Securities (G-Sec) and Corporate Bonds.
* **Forex Market:** (Foreign Exchange Market).
* **Stock Market:** (Equity Market).
* **Commodities Market.**

**(b) Journey of the Banking Sector (Approx. 5 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017) portray the journey of the Indian banking sector through three distinct phases:
1. **Phase 1 (1950s-1960s):** Characterized as underdeveloped *laissez-faire* banking, marked by limited access to finance for the productive sector and significant instability, evidenced by a large number of bank failures.
2. **Phase 2 (1970s-1980s):** This era saw financial development under government control. Key events included the nationalization of major private banks (14 in 1969, 6 more in 1980), leading to substantial government ownership. The period exhibited classical symptoms of financial repression: high pre-emption of resources via mandatory Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), complex administered interest rates, and quantitative ceilings on sectoral credit, all heavily directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) were established in 1975 to improve rural credit access.
3. **Phase 3 (1990s onwards):** Marked by gradual and calibrated financial deepening and liberalization, initiated based on recommendations from the Narasimham Committees (1991, 1998). Key reforms included:
    * **Reduction of Financial Repression:** Significant lowering of CRR and SLR, dismantling administered interest rates for better price discovery.
    * **Enhanced Competition:** Licensing of new private sector banks in the mid-1990s and again in 2015, along with recent licensing of differentiated banks (Small Finance Banks and Payments Banks).
    * **Strengthened Regulation & Supervision:** Introduction of modern prudential norms and improved supervisory practices.
    * **Technological Upgradation:** Establishment of modern payment systems (INFINET, RTGS), core banking solutions, boosting efficiency.
    * **Improved Credit Culture:** Enactment of the SARFAESI Act (2002), establishment of Credit Information Bureaus (2005), and the Bankruptcy Act (2016) to address Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and improve creditors' rights.
    * **Diversification:** Shift towards retail and housing finance, diversifying bank asset bases.
    Despite these reforms and the entry of private players, public sector banks continued to hold a dominant share (over 70%) of banking assets as of the mid-2010s, though their performance and asset quality (rising NPAs post-2009) remained areas of concern.

**(c) Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) in the 70s/80s and their Decline:**
* **Names:** Mohan and Ray (2017, fn. 7) mention several DFIs established from the 1950s/60s which operated through the 70s and 80s: Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI), Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI), National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), National Housing Bank (NHB), and Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI).
* **Reasons for Decline/Becoming Defunct:** The paper states that by the 1990s, DFIs became non-viable due to:
    1. Stoppage of refinance facilities from the RBI.
    2. Cessation of government budgetary support.
    3. Accumulation of non-performing assets on their loan portfolios.
    Consequently, in the liberalized era, major DFIs like IDBI and ICICI were converted into commercial banks, IFCI became effectively non-functional, while others like NABARD, NHB, and SIDBI continued primarily as refinance institutions with government support.

### **9. Point out the major instruments of monetary policy of RBI. Distinguish between CRR and SLR in accordance with their purpose. Explain the difference between the working mechanism of repo rate change and reverse repo rate change to control money supply in India. (2+3+5)**

**(a) Major Instruments of Monetary Policy (2 marks):**
Based on Mohan and Ray (2017), the major instruments of monetary policy employed or referred to by the RBI include:
* Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
* Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)
* Bank Rate (Historically significant, less so currently)
* Repo Rate (The primary policy rate under the LAF)
* Reverse Repo Rate (Part of the LAF corridor)
* Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) - the framework through which repo and reverse repo operations are conducted.

**(b) Distinction between CRR and SLR Purpose (3 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017) discuss CRR and SLR primarily in the context of financial repression and subsequent reforms:
* **Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):** This represents the proportion of a bank's net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) that it must maintain as cash balances with the RBI. In the pre-reform era (1970s-80s), a high CRR served as a major tool of *resource pre-emption*, diverting funds away from banks' lendable resources, effectively channeling them towards government needs and contributing to financial repression. Its gradual reduction since the 1990s (from 15% to around 4%) was a key reform aimed at increasing the availability of lendable resources for the banking sector.
* **Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR):** This is defined (fn. 10) as the proportion of aggregate deposits (or NDTL, fn. 11) that banks must maintain in the form of government and other approved securities. Similar to CRR, a high SLR (nearly 40% in the early 1990s) was a tool for *resource pre-emption*, compelling banks to finance government deficits by holding government bonds, thus "crowding out" credit to the private sector. Its reduction (to around 21.5% by mid-2010s) significantly enhanced banks' ability to lend to the commercial sector.

**Purpose Distinction:** While both impound bank resources, the paper highlights their historical purpose primarily as tools for *resource pre-emption* under the financially repressed regime, ensuring funds were available for the government. The reduction of both CRR and SLR was central to *liberalization* by freeing up bank resources for lending.

**(c) Working Mechanism of Repo and Reverse Repo Rate Changes (5 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017) explain that the RBI's monetary policy framework aims at setting the policy **Repo Rate**, which transmits through the money market to influence broader interest rates. The **Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)** is the operating framework for managing day-to-day liquidity, aiming to keep the weighted average call money rate (WACR) anchored around the Repo Rate.
* **Repo Rate Mechanism:** The Repo rate is defined (fn. 12) as the fixed interest rate at which the RBI provides short-term (typically overnight) liquidity to banks against the collateral of government securities.
    * **Effect of Change:** When the RBI *lowers* the Repo rate, it reduces the cost for banks to borrow funds from the central bank. This can encourage banks to borrow more to meet their short-term liquidity needs, potentially increasing liquidity in the banking system and signaling an easing monetary policy stance, which tends to lower other money market rates. Conversely, when the RBI *raises* the Repo rate, borrowing from the RBI becomes more expensive, discouraging banks from accessing LAF funds, thus tightening liquidity conditions and signaling a contractionary stance.
* **Reverse Repo Rate Mechanism:** The Reverse Repo rate functions as the floor of the LAF corridor (Figure 3) and represents the rate at which the RBI *absorbs* liquidity from banks that have surplus funds, against eligible government securities.
    * **Effect of Change:** When the RBI *raises* the Reverse Repo rate, it makes it more attractive for banks to park their surplus funds with the RBI. This leads to absorption of liquidity from the system, contributing to tighter monetary conditions. When the RBI *lowers* the Reverse Repo rate, parking funds with the RBI becomes less remunerative, potentially leaving more liquidity in the hands of banks, which could then be used for lending, thereby easing liquidity conditions.

**Difference in Mechanism:** The core difference lies in the direction of the liquidity flow and the policy signal. Repo operations *inject* liquidity (at the Repo rate, the policy ceiling/signal), while Reverse Repo operations *absorb* liquidity (at the Reverse Repo rate, the policy floor). Changes in the Repo Rate are the primary signal of the monetary policy stance, while adjustments in the corridor width (spread between Repo and Reverse Repo) and the rates themselves manage day-to-day liquidity and guide short-term interest rates in the money market.

### **10. State the primary recommendation of Narasimham committee 1998. How does the IT accelerate the transformative journey of Indian Banking? Discuss the select outcomes of the banking sector reforms in India’s goods market and money market (2+3+5)**

**(a) Primary Recommendation of Narasimham Committee 1998 (2 marks):**
According to Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 8), the Narasimham Committee 1998 primarily recommended further measures for **modernising the banking sector through better regulation and supervision, and the introduction of prudential norms**. This included tighter non-performing asset (NPA) recognition, risk management, and provisioning requirements. Additionally, it advocated for the establishment of Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) to handle stressed assets and suggested mergers among strong banks while allowing weak ones to exit. It also suggested a review of the bank ownership structure in India, specifically reducing government ownership of public banks to less than 33%.

**(b) Role of IT in Banking Transformation (3 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 11) highlight that Information Technology (IT) played a key role in the transformative journey of Indian banking by enabling:
* **More effective, lower cost, and real-time delivery of financial services.**
* **Establishment of a modern payments system**, underpinned by infrastructure like the Indian Financial Network (INFINET) as the communication backbone.
* **Introduction of advanced systems** such as the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) and Core Banking Solutions (CBS) across most bank branches nationwide.
* **Institutional support** through bodies like the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), established by the RBI in 1996, which promoted connectivity and common IT standards.
* **Competitive impetus**, as new private sector banks adopted new IT from inception, spurring public sector banks towards similar adoption.

**(c) Select Outcomes of Banking Reforms in Goods and Money Markets (5 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017) discuss several outcomes stemming from the banking sector reforms that impacted the goods and money markets:
**Goods Market Outcomes:**
* The entry of new private sector banks and institutions like HDFC initiated a significant expansion in **retail lending and housing finance** starting in the late 1990s (p. 11).
* This increased availability of consumer credit **boosted demand for goods** such as automobiles, two-wheelers, and other consumer durables.
* This demand stimulation contributed to **overall economic growth** and helped **diversify the asset base** of banks beyond traditional corporate lending.

**Money Market Outcomes:**
* The money market transformed from an "archaic" state to a **deeper, more diverse, and primarily inter-bank market** (p. 10, 13).
* The **Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)** framework was established, with the Repo Rate acting as the policy anchor, improving monetary policy transmission (p. 10, 13).
* **New instruments** like Collateralized Borrowing and Lending Obligations (CBLO) and market repo were introduced, widening participation beyond just banks and deepening the market (p. 13-14).
* **Institutional reforms**, notably the establishment of the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) as a central counterparty, significantly improved market efficiency, transparency, liquidity, and risk management, while reducing settlement risks and costs (p. 13).
* Overall activity (turnover) in various money market segments increased significantly (p. 13, Table 3).

### **11. Mention the reforms in banking sector in India since 1991. Briefly discuss the emerging issues in banking sector in India. Point out the causes for the deterioration of asset quality in public sector banks during 2010-11-2015-16. (3+3+4)**

**(a) Banking Sector Reforms Since 1991 (3 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 8-11) outline several key banking sector reforms initiated since the early 1990s:
1. **Reduction of Financial Repression:** Significant lowering of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) to increase lendable resources.
2. **Interest Rate Liberalization:** Dismantling the complex administered interest rate structure to enable price discovery.
3. **Enhanced Competition:** Licensing new private sector banks (mid-1990s, 2015) and newer differentiated banks (Payments Banks, Small Finance Banks).
4. **Strengthened Regulation & Prudential Norms:** Modernizing the banking sector through improved regulation, supervision, and introduction of prudential standards.
5. **Technological Modernization:** Implementing modern payment systems (INFINET, RTGS) and core banking solutions.
6. **Improving Credit Recovery:** Enacting the SARFAESI Act (2002), establishing Credit Information Bureaus (2005), and passing the Bankruptcy Act (2016).
7. **Ownership Reforms:** Allowing public sector banks (PSBs) to raise equity from the market (subject to 51% government ownership).

**(b) Emerging Issues in the Banking Sector (3 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 14-15, 19) highlight several emerging issues as of mid-2016:
1. **Deterioration of Asset Quality:** The most significant concern was the rise in Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and overall stressed assets, particularly acute in Public Sector Banks (PSBs), after a period of improvement post-reforms.
2. **PSB Performance and Dominance:** Despite reforms and private entry, PSBs continued to dominate the sector (over 70% assets) but showed significantly lower profitability compared to their asset share, raising questions about inherent efficiency versus governance structures and potential bureaucratic interference.
3. **Efficiency vs. Equity Dilemma:** PSBs potentially continued to be constrained by societal concerns and mandates, creating a conflict between efficiency goals and equity objectives.
4. **Uncertainty of New Entrants:** The impact and viability of the newly licensed Payments Banks and Small Finance Banks were largely unknown unknowns at the time.
5. **Financial Inclusion:** While progress was made, achieving universal financial inclusion remained a significant challenge ("much to achieve", p.19).
6. **Co-operative Bank Vulnerability:** Financial results indicated some vulnerability in the co-operative banking structure, though perhaps not systemically critical.

**(c) Causes for Asset Quality Deterioration in PSBs (2010/11-2015/16) (4 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 16) point to several potential factors contributing to the accumulation of NPAs in recent years, primarily affecting the industrial sector (infrastructure, steel):
1. **Regulatory Forbearance:** Relaxed credit norms by the RBI in the aftermath of the North Atlantic Financial Crisis (NAFC) to encourage bank lending may have led to inadequate risk assessment.
2. **Structural Factors & Commodity Price Fall:** Sharp declines in commodity prices and other structural issues negatively impacted the profitability of sectors like steel, impairing their ability to service debt.
3. **Infrastructure Push (PPP Model):** Government emphasis on infrastructure investment via Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) led to high leverage among investing corporate entities. Banks may have deviated from rigorous credit appraisal due to government pressure or private sector enthusiasm.
4. **Governance Issues & Political Interference:** Allegations surfaced regarding governance problems within select PSBs and potential political interference, possibly leading to lending decisions being divorced from standard credit evaluation processes and due diligence.

### **12. Discuss the major initiatives taken by the Government of India and RBI for financial inclusion. Compare the payment banks and the small finance banks in respect of their objectives and business model. Mention the recent developments with regard to entry of new private sector banks. (4+3+3)**

**(a) Major Initiatives for Financial Inclusion (4 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 16-18) discuss a multi-pronged approach towards financial inclusion involving various initiatives over time:
* **Priority Sector Lending (PSL):** Stipulations requiring commercial banks to lend a specific percentage (40%) of their credit to designated priority sectors (agriculture, MSMEs, education, housing, etc.), with mechanisms like RIDF and PSLCs to manage shortfalls.
* **Opening No-Frills Accounts:** Simplifying account opening procedures for basic banking access.
* **Kisan Credit Card (KCC):** A specific credit card product designed for the farming community.
* **Business Correspondents (BCs):** Engaging intermediaries to provide banking and financial services in remote areas.
* **Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY):** Launched in 2014, this national mission aimed for universal access to banking with at least one basic account per household, bundled with a Debit card and insurance cover.
* **Differentiated Banks:** Licensing new types of banks – Small Finance Banks and Payments Banks – specifically aimed at furthering financial inclusion through targeted business models (savings mobilization, credit for underserved segments, payments/remittances).
* *Historical Context:* The paper also notes earlier efforts like the establishment of Post Office Savings Banks, Co-operative Banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), and the nationalization of banks as steps taken over decades to promote inclusion.

**(b) Comparison of Payment Banks and Small Finance Banks (3 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 18) differentiate these two new types of banks:

| Feature               | Payment Banks                                                                                                                                                                                           | Small Finance Banks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Objective** | Facilitate payments and remittances, especially for small savers/migrants.                                                                                                                              | Further financial inclusion via savings mobilization & credit supply to underserved segments.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Business Model**    | **Narrow Banking:** Accept deposits (up to ₹100k), pay interest. **No lending activity.** Focus on payments/remittances using mobile tech. Issue debit/ATM cards. Invest only in government securities. | **Full Banking (Smaller Scale):** Accept deposits. Provide credit, focusing on small ticket loans (<₹2.5m for 50% of portfolio). Serve small business units, small/marginal farmers, micro/small industries, unorganized sector. High tech, low-cost model emphasized. |
| **Target Segment**    | Primarily those needing payment/remittance services.                                                                                                                                                    | Small business units, small/marginal farmers, micro/small industries, unorganized sector entities.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Nature**            | Payments & transaction-focused.                                                                                                                                                                         | Savings & credit-focused for underserved populations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

**(c) Recent Developments Regarding New Private Bank Entry (3 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 10, 18) mention the following recent developments concerning the entry of new private banks as of mid-2016:
1.  **Resumption of Universal Bank Licensing:** After nearly a decade, licenses were granted in 2015 to two institutions (IDFC Ltd., Bandhan Financial Services) to operate as universal commercial banks.
2.  **Move Towards 'On Tap' Licensing:** The RBI released Draft Guidelines in May 2016 for 'on tap' licensing of universal banks, signaling a potential shift from the previous "stop and go" approach to licensing rounds.
3.  **Introduction of Differentiated Banks:** Licenses were issued for two new categories: Payments Banks (11 initially licensed in Aug 2015, though 3 later surrendered) and Small Finance Banks (10 licensed), marking a departure from issuing only universal bank licenses.
4.  **Entry of Industry Houses (Limited):** Notably, some large industry houses were granted licenses for Payments Banks, justified by the non-lending nature of these banks, thus mitigating conflict-of-interest concerns related to intra-group lending.

### **13. State the recommendations of Malhotra Committee. Give a brief account of the outcomes of the insurance sector reforms in India. Discuss the opportunities for further development of the insurance business in India. (2+5+3)**

**(a) Recommendations of Malhotra Committee (2 marks):**
Based on Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 19), the high-powered committee headed by R. N. Malhotra (set up in 1993) initiated the insurance sector reforms process with key recommendations including:
1. Opening up the insurance sector to private players, encompassing both domestic and foreign entities (preferably through joint ventures with Indian partners).
2. Establishment of an autonomous body, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), to regulate, develop, and promote competition in the sector.

**(b) Outcomes of Insurance Sector Reforms (5 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 19-20) describe several outcomes following the implementation of insurance sector reforms:
* **End of Monopoly:** The monopoly held by the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) since 1956 and the General Insurance Corporation (GIC) since 1972 was repealed by the IRDA Act, 1999.
* **Private Sector Entry:** The sector saw significant entry of private companies; by March 2015, there were 24 life insurance and 28 general insurance companies operating alongside public sector incumbents.
* **Establishment of Regulator:** The IRDA was constituted as an autonomous statutory body in April 2000, tasked with protecting policyholder interests and ensuring orderly industry growth.
* **Increased Foreign Investment Limit:** The limit for foreign investment in the insurance sector was enhanced from 26 percent to 49 percent under the automatic route.
* **Initial Growth and Subsequent Slowdown:** The sector experienced robust growth in the first decade after opening (around 31% in new business premiums, 2001-2010), but faced a slowdown thereafter.
* **Penetration Trends:** Insurance penetration (premium to GDP ratio) in the life segment increased from 2.2% in 2002 to a peak of 4.6% in 2010, but subsequently declined to 2.6% by 2014. General insurance penetration remained relatively low (around 0.7% in 2014-15). India's overall penetration lagged behind comparable Asian economies.
* **Continued Public Sector Dominance:** Despite private entry, LIC retained a dominant market share (~73% of total premium in 2014-15). In non-life, public and private sectors held roughly equal shares.
* **Increased Role in Household Savings:** Life insurance funds became a more significant component of household financial assets, hovering around 20% of the change in gross financial assets in recent years.

**(c) Opportunities for Further Development (3 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 19-21) suggest significant opportunities for the future development of the Indian insurance sector:
* **Addressing Low Penetration:** There is substantial scope for increasing insurance penetration, which remains low compared to international benchmarks and even some Asian peers, particularly in the life and health segments.
* **Tapping Huge Untapped Potential:** Given India's population size and low current penetration, especially in areas like health insurance, the potential market is vast.
* **Expanding Social Protection:** Greater expansion of insurance services is needed to enhance social security nets for the population.
* **Developing Capital Markets:** Growth in insurance funds, particularly long-term funds from life insurance and pensions, is crucial for deepening capital markets, especially the corporate debt market which relies on institutional investors.
* **Improving Efficiency and Distribution:** Opportunities exist in overcoming challenges related to distribution (moving beyond archaic agent models, addressing mis-selling), optimizing government control, easing regulatory constraints, and improving consumer education and protection.

### **14. Mention the key reform measures taken in respect of bond and security market in India since early 1990s. What are the types of bond markets in India? Discuss the improvement of the Indian capital market due to reforms. What are the causes for the underdevelopment of corporate debt market is India. (3+1+3+3)**

**(a) Key Bond/Security Market Reforms Since Early 1990s (3 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 22-24) highlight the following key reforms impacting the bond (specifically Government Securities) and broader securities market:
1. **Government Securities Market Reform:** Transition from a system of deficit financing via fixed coupon *ad-hoc* Treasury bills to a market-driven auction process conducted on an electronic platform by the late 1990s.
2. **Establishment of Market Infrastructure:** Creation of Primary Dealers (PDs) in 1995 to act as market makers in the government securities market. Establishment of depositories (NSDL 1996, CSDL 1999) enabling paperless trading, and the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) improving clearing and settlement (p. 13).
3. **Liberalization of Capital Issuance:** Repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 in 1992, liberalizing the process for companies to raise capital from the market.

**(b) Types of Bond Markets in India (1 mark):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 22) differentiate the bond market based on ownership into two main types:
1.  Government bonds (Government Securities or G-Secs)
2.  Corporate bonds

**(c) Improvement of Indian Capital Market Due to Reforms (3 marks):**
The reforms led to significant improvements in the Indian capital market, particularly the equity market (Mohan and Ray 2017, p. 23-25):
* **Modern Institutional Structure:** Creation of growth-enabling institutions like the statutory regulator SEBI (empowered in 1992) and the modern, electronic, demutualized National Stock Exchange (NSE, established 1992).
* **Enhanced Efficiency and Transparency:** Introduction of electronic trading, depositories for paperless settlement (T+2), and central counterparty clearing (via CCIL) reduced transaction costs, improved price discovery, and increased overall market efficiency and transparency.
* **Improved Investor Confidence and Protection:** SEBI's regulatory oversight, improved disclosure norms, and modernized market infrastructure boosted investor confidence.
* **Market Growth and Liquidity:** The markets witnessed significant growth in size (market capitalization) and liquidity (turnover).
* **Introduction of Derivatives:** Trading in derivatives (index futures/options, stock futures/options) was introduced, adding depth to the market.

**(d) Causes for Underdevelopment of Corporate Debt Market (3 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 22-23) identify several reasons for the relatively underdeveloped state of the corporate debt market in India:
1. **Preference for External Borrowing:** Large corporates often prefer to raise longer-term debt from international markets.
2. **Limited Domestic Institutional Investor Base:** The pension and insurance sectors, which are natural long-term investors in corporate debt, remain underdeveloped in India, limiting the demand-side pool of funds.
3. **Lack of Other Investors:** Limited availability of other types of investors to participate significantly in the corporate debt market.
4. **Dominance of Private Placements:** The market is heavily reliant on private placements, which offer limited liquidity compared to public issues.
5. **Concentration:** Activity is largely confined to bonds issued by top-rated, blue-chip companies.

### **15. Write a note on: (a) Reforms in Mutual Fund segment of the Indian Capital Market (b) Reforms in Pension Funds in India. (5+5)**

**(a) Reforms in Mutual Fund Segment (5 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 25-26) outline the key reforms and evolution of the Mutual Fund (MF) segment in India:
* **End of Monopoly:** The reform process began in 1988, ending the monopoly held by the Unit Trust of India (UTI) since 1963. This phase saw the entry of MFs sponsored by public sector banks, LIC, and GIC.
* **Private Sector Entry:** A significant step was allowing private sector entities to establish MFs in 1993, fostering competition.
* **Regulatory Framework:** The issuance of the SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations in 1996 provided a formal regulatory structure and paved the way for greater operational freedom for MF players.
* **UTI Restructuring:** Following difficulties with its flagship US-64 scheme in 2001, UTI underwent a major restructuring. It was bifurcated into the Specified Undertaking of UTI (SUUTI), holding the problematic assets, and the UTI Mutual Fund, which was established on lines similar to other MFs and sponsored by select public sector institutions (PSBs and LIC).
* **Market Development:** These reforms led to substantial growth in the number of Asset Management Companies (AMCs) (44 by March 2016) and Assets Under Management (AUM) (around Rs 13.5 trillion or 10% of GDP by March 2016). While initially dominated by UTI and then public sector funds, the private sector MFs grew significantly to command a larger share of net resource mobilization over time. The reforms facilitated the development of both equity and debt-oriented schemes, providing an important avenue for pooling resources and investing in securities.

**(b) Reforms in Pension Funds (5 marks):**
Mohan and Ray (2017, p. 26-27) detail the significant reforms undertaken in the Indian pension sector:
* **Shift from Defined-Benefit to Defined-Contribution:** Recognizing the potential fiscal unsustainability of the traditional defined-benefit pension schemes, particularly for government employees, the Government of India introduced a major reform by launching the defined-contribution based "New Pension System" (NPS) in January 2004. Initially for new government recruits, it was later opened to the private sector.
* **Establishment of a Regulator:** To oversee the nascent sector, the government constituted the Interim Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) in 2003.
* **Statutory Authority for Regulator:** The PFRDA eventually began functioning as a statutory regulator for the NPS in 2014, providing a formal legal and regulatory framework for the sector.
* **Choice-Based Architecture:** The NPS operates on a choice-based model. Subscribers can select from multiple (8 as of March 2016) competing pension fund managers, which are typically floated by established financial institutions like public sector banks and insurance companies, to manage their retirement savings.
* **Objective:** These reforms aim to create a fiscally sustainable retirement system, promote old-age income security through individual accounts, and potentially develop pension funds as significant long-term institutional investors in the financial markets (both debt and equity), contributing to market depth and financing infrastructure projects. Despite these reforms, the sector remains nascent compared to the size of the population and economy.
