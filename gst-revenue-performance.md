### **18. What is meant by cascading effect of indirect taxation? Do you think Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India has eliminated the cascading effect? Explain your opinion. Mention the advantages of GST according to the advocates of GST in India? Discuss how the implementation of GST triggers inequality in our country. (2+2+3+3)**

**(a) Cascading Effect of Indirect Taxation (2 marks):**
The cascading effect, or 'tax-on-tax', is a phenomenon in a multi-stage indirect tax system where tax is levied on the value of a good or service at each stage of production and distribution, *without* allowing for credit of taxes paid at previous stages. This means that the tax base at each subsequent stage includes the tax paid at the preceding stage, leading to an artificial increase in the final price paid by the consumer and distortions in the production chain.

**(b) Elimination of Cascading Effect by GST (2 marks):**
Yes, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India is designed to largely eliminate the cascading effect. It achieves this through the comprehensive **Input Tax Credit (ITC)** mechanism. Under GST, a registered business paying tax on inputs (goods or services) used in their business activities can claim credit for that tax against their output tax liability. This ensures that tax is effectively levied only on the value addition at each stage, breaking the tax-on-tax chain that existed under the previous indirect tax regime (e.g., Central Excise Duty, State VAT, Service Tax). While the mechanism is largely successful, certain exceptions (like taxes on petroleum products outside GST, or businesses under composition scheme) might still exhibit some residual cascading.

**(c) Advantages of GST (3 marks):**
According to advocates, the key advantages of GST in India include:
*   **Elimination of Cascading Effect:** As discussed above, leading to a reduction in the overall tax burden on the supply chain and potentially lower prices for consumers.
*   **Creation of a Common National Market:** By subsuming multiple central and state taxes into a single tax, GST removes inter-state tax barriers (like Central Sales Tax, Entry Tax), facilitating seamless movement of goods and services across the country.
*   **Simplified Tax Structure:** Replaces numerous complex indirect taxes with a single, unified system with common procedures, forms, and compliance requirements.
*   **Increased Tax Base and Formalization:** The ITC mechanism incentivizes businesses to register and report transactions, bringing more economic activity into the formal sector and broadening the tax base.
*   **Improved Ease of Doing Business:** Reduces compliance costs and complexities for businesses operating across states.
*   **Boost to Exports:** Taxes on inputs used in exports are fully refundable under GST, making Indian exports more competitive in the international market.

**(d) GST Implementation and Inequality (3 marks):**
The implementation of GST can potentially trigger or exacerbate inequality in certain ways:
*   **Regressive Nature:** Like most indirect taxes, GST is inherently regressive in its impact. It is levied uniformly on consumption, regardless of income level. Poor households spend a larger proportion of their income on goods and services compared to rich households, meaning the tax burden as a percentage of income is higher for lower-income groups. While India has multiple GST rates and exemptions for essential goods, the overall structure still places a proportionally heavier burden on the poor.
*   **Compliance Burden on Small Businesses:** While GST aims for simplification, the digital compliance requirements (filing multiple monthly returns, matching invoices) can be burdensome for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), especially those in rural areas or with limited digital infrastructure and accounting expertise. This can increase their operating costs or push some towards the informal sector, while larger businesses with resources find it easier to comply.
*   **Impact on Specific Sectors/States:** The shift to a destination-based consumption tax model means that states that are net consumers benefit more in terms of revenue collection compared to states that are primarily producers or transit hubs, potentially affecting regional inequality in state finances.

These factors suggest that while GST brings macroeconomic efficiency gains, its microeconomic impact on income distribution and small businesses requires careful consideration and potentially targeted policy interventions.

### **19. Mention the central and state taxes subsumed under GST in India. Discuss how the introduction of GST accelerate the indirect tax collection in India during last five years. Is it stagflationary? Explain. In the context of GST illustrate the concept of revenue neutral tax rate and its implications in Indian economy. (2+2+2+4)**

**(a) Central and State Taxes Subsumed under GST (2 marks):**
Key Central Taxes subsumed:
*   Central Excise Duty
*   Duties of Excise (Medicinal and Toilet Preparations)
*   Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance)
*   Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile Products)
*   Additional Duties of Customs (commonly known as CVD and SAD)
*   Service Tax
*   Central Surcharges and Cesses relating to supply of goods and services.

Key State Taxes subsumed:
*   State Value Added Tax (VAT) / Sales Tax
*   Central Sales Tax (CST)
*   Purchase Tax
*   Luxury Tax
*   Entry Tax (all forms)
*   Entertainment Tax (except those levied by local bodies)
*   Taxes on advertisements
*   Taxes on lotteries, betting, and gambling
*   State Surcharges and Cesses relating to supply of goods and services.

**(b) Acceleration of Indirect Tax Collection (Last 5 Years) (2 marks):**
Since its implementation in July 2017, GST collections have shown a positive trend, particularly over the last five years (roughly FY2019-20 to FY2023-24). The acceleration can be attributed to several factors:
*   **Economic Growth:** Overall economic recovery and growth directly boost consumption and production, leading to higher tax collection.
*   **Improved Compliance:** Implementation of anti-evasion measures, data analytics, e-invoicing, e-way bills, and better integration of IT systems has significantly improved tax compliance and reduced leakage.
*   **Formalization of Economy:** The incentives under GST (especially ITC) have encouraged more businesses to join the formal economy, expanding the tax base.
*   **Rate Rationalization:** Periodic adjustments and rationalization of GST rates by the GST Council have also contributed to revenue stability and growth. Monthly gross GST collections have frequently crossed significant milestones, reflecting this upward trajectory, indicating accelerated growth compared to the fragmented system that preceded it.

**(c) Is GST Stagflationary? (2 marks):**
No, GST itself is not inherently stagflationary. Stagflation is characterized by high inflation coupled with high unemployment and stagnant demand/output. While the initial implementation of GST might have led to some temporary price increases for certain goods and services due to rate changes or adjustment costs, this was not a structural driver of persistent high inflation alongside economic stagnation. In the long run, by improving efficiency, reducing costs, and removing trade barriers, GST is expected to be disinflationary or neutral. Its primary impact is on the structure of taxation and economic efficiency, not directly on the factors causing stagflation.

**(d) Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) and Implications (4 marks):**
*   **Concept of RNR:** The Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) in the context of GST refers to a single rate or a structure of rates designed such that the total revenue collected under the new GST system is *approximately equivalent* to the total revenue collected from the various central and state indirect taxes that were subsumed, *before* the implementation of GST. The idea is to transition to the new system without causing a significant loss or gain in aggregate tax revenue for the government exchequer (Centre + States) in the initial phase.
*   **Calculation:** RNR is typically calculated based on past tax revenues, consumption patterns, and the tax base under the old regime, taking into account the potential expansion of the tax base under the new system. Various committees provided estimates for India's RNR, typically suggesting a rate in the range of 15-18%.
*   **Implications in Indian Economy:**
    *   **Rate Structure Design:** The RNR served as a crucial reference point for the GST Council in designing the multi-tier rate structure (0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28% plus cesses) to ensure that the weighted average rate was close to the calculated RNR, minimizing initial revenue shocks.
    *   **Compensation Mechanism:** The potential for revenue loss for states, especially in the initial years, necessitated a compensation mechanism. The RNR calculation underpinned the understanding of the potential revenue shortfall that states might face, justifying the need for the Central government to compensate states for any revenue growth below a guaranteed 14% annual increase for the first five years.
    *   **Policy Trade-offs:** Determining the RNR involved complex trade-offs between revenue needs, equity considerations (exempting essential goods), and ease of administration. The multi-rate structure, while deviating from a 'pure' single RNR, was adopted to balance these objectives, reflecting the complexities of the Indian economy and political consensus-building.
    *   **Post-Implementation Assessment:** Actual revenue performance post-GST implementation is continuously compared against RNR projections to assess the system's effectiveness and guide future rate rationalization discussions within the GST Council.

### **20. Discuss the major reforms in India’s indirect tax system since 1950s. Examine the overall revenue performance of GST in recent years. (5+5)**

**(a) Major Reforms in India's Indirect Tax System since 1950s (5 marks):**
India's indirect tax system has undergone significant structural changes since independence, moving from a fragmented, origin-based system towards a more unified, destination-based consumption tax:
*   **Early Post-Independence (1950s-1960s):** Characterized by a mix of Central Excise Duties (mainly on manufactured goods) and State Sales Taxes. Sales taxes were origin-based for inter-state trade (Central Sales Tax - CST, introduced in 1956) and destination-based within states (State Sales Tax/VAT). This system suffered from cascading and complexity.
*   **Introduction of MODVAT/CENVAT (1980s-1990s):** Recognizing the cascading effect of Excise Duty, the Modified Value Added Tax (MODVAT) was introduced in 1986, initially for selected commodities, allowing manufacturers to claim credit for excise paid on inputs. This was later expanded and renamed CENVAT (Central Value Added Tax) in 2000, covering more goods and extending credit across stages of manufacturing. This was a crucial step towards a VAT system at the central level.
*   **Introduction of Service Tax (1994):** Service Tax was introduced on a limited set of services and gradually expanded to cover almost all services by the early 2000s. This was a significant expansion of the central tax base, but the lack of seamless credit between CENVAT (on goods) and Service Tax (on services) perpetuated some cascading.
*   **Implementation of State VATs (Early 2000s):** States began replacing their cascading State Sales Taxes with a Value Added Tax (VAT) system, largely between 2003 and 2006. State VAT was destination-based within the state and allowed credit for tax paid on inputs within the state. However, CST on inter-state sales remained a major source of cascading and inhibited a national market.
*   **The Journey to GST (Late 2000s - 2017):** The idea of a unified Goods and Services Tax was mooted to subsume CENVAT, Service Tax, State VATs, CST, and other levies, thereby creating a national VAT and a common market. This required complex negotiations between the Centre and states on rate structures, administration, and compensation. The 101st Constitutional Amendment paved the way, and GST was finally implemented on July 1, 2017. GST is a dual VAT model, with simultaneous levy of Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST) on intra-state supplies, and Integrated GST (IGST) on inter-state supplies and imports.

**(b) Overall Revenue Performance of GST in Recent Years (5 marks):**
The revenue performance of GST in recent years (roughly FY2020-21 to FY2023-24) has shown robust growth and stabilization after the initial implementation phase and the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic:
*   **Consistent Growth:** Monthly gross GST collections have demonstrated a clear upward trend. Average monthly collections have steadily risen, frequently crossing the ₹1.5 lakh crore mark and occasionally exceeding ₹1.8 or ₹2 lakh crore, indicating healthy underlying economic activity and improved compliance.
*   **Recovery Post-Pandemic:** Following a dip during the initial pandemic lockdowns, collections rebounded strongly, demonstrating the resilience of the system and the economy.
*   **Contribution of Compliance Measures:** Enhanced use of technology (e-way bills, e-invoicing, data analytics, AI) has played a crucial role in detecting evasion and improving compliance, directly contributing to higher revenues. The drive against fake registrations and fraudulent ITC claims has also yielded positive results.
*   **Economic Formalization:** The expansion of the tax base as more businesses transition from informal to formal operations under the GST framework contributes to long-term revenue growth.
*   **Comparison with Old Regime:** While direct like-for-like comparisons are complex due to the structural change, the sustained growth rates in GST revenue in recent years often surpass the historical growth rates of the subsumed taxes combined, suggesting an improvement in tax buoyancy over time.
*   **Stability:** The volatility in monthly collections, while still present, has reduced compared to the initial months, suggesting greater stability in the revenue stream.

Overall, the GST revenue performance in recent years is generally considered positive, reflecting both economic recovery and improvements in tax administration and compliance, making it a significant and growing source of public finance for both the Union and State governments.

### **21. Compare the evolution of GST revenue for the state governments and the union government in India during the GST with compensation regime. Mention the indication of the revenue performance of the union and the state governments in the regime of GST without compensation. The GST council is yet to decide about the compensation cess. Analyse how the distribution of revenues among the centre and the states would be affected if the compensation cess become a part of the regular rate structure of GST. (4+2+4)**

**(a) Evolution of GST Revenue: State vs. Union (Compensation Regime) (4 marks):**
During the GST with compensation regime (July 2017 to June 2022), the revenue evolution for states and the Union government had distinct dynamics:
*   **State Revenue:** States collected SGST (State GST) on intra-state sales and received a share of IGST (Integrated GST) collected on inter-state sales and imports (via the apportionment mechanism). Crucially, states were guaranteed a revenue growth of 14% per annum over their base year (FY 2015-16) revenue for the first five years. Any shortfall below this guaranteed growth was compensated by the Central government from the Compensation Cess fund.
    *   **Evolution:** States' own SGST/IGST revenue growth varied depending on their economic structure and consumption patterns. However, their *total* GST revenue (SGST + IGST share + Compensation) was effectively smoothed and guaranteed to grow at 14%. This provided states with significant revenue stability and predictability, especially in the initial years and during economic downturns like the pandemic. States' actual SGST/IGST collections *without* compensation might have been lower than the guaranteed 14% in some periods, but the compensation payments filled this gap.
*   **Union Revenue:** The Union government collected CGST (Central GST) on intra-state sales and received its share of IGST. It also collected the Compensation Cess. The Union did not have a guaranteed growth rate; its revenue depended directly on CGST and IGST collections.
    *   **Evolution:** Union revenue fluctuated more directly with economic activity and compliance levels. The Union also bore the primary fiscal risk associated with the compensation mechanism, as it had to collect enough Compensation Cess (or borrow and later repay) to meet the states' guaranteed revenue.

**Comparison:** The key difference was the states' revenue guarantee, providing stability and predictability funded by the Centre (via cess). The Union's revenue was more volatile but included the Cess collection, which was earmarked for compensation. States had a clearer revenue trajectory (14% growth), while the Union's revenue varied more based on overall collection performance.

**(b) Revenue Performance Indication (Without Compensation Regime) (2 marks):**
Since July 2022, the compensation regime has ended. In the absence of compensation, states now rely solely on their own SGST collections and their share of IGST apportionment.
*   **Indication:** The indication from this period is that state revenues are now directly exposed to fluctuations in their own economic activity and consumption. States with higher economic growth and consumption bases are likely to see stronger SGST/IGST growth, while others might face revenue constraints if their own GST collections are modest. Similarly, the Union's revenue remains tied to CGST/IGST collections. The removal of the compensation mechanism means states have lost the revenue safety net, making their own collection performance and the IGST distribution mechanism critically important for their fiscal health.

**(c) Effect if Compensation Cess Becomes Part of Regular Rate Structure (4 marks):**
If the Compensation Cess is absorbed into the regular GST rate structure (i.e., merged into the CGST, SGST, and IGST rates), the distribution of revenues would be significantly affected:
*   **Increased Divisible Pool:** Currently, the Compensation Cess collected is outside the divisible pool of CGST/SGST/IGST and is specifically used for compensating states for revenue shortfalls. If this cess amount is merged into the standard rates, the total collection from CGST, SGST, and IGST would increase.
*   **Impact on States' Revenue Share:** The additional revenue generated from the merged cess (now part of CGST/SGST/IGST) would be subject to the standard GST revenue sharing formula, which is decided by the GST Council.
    *   If the cess amount is distributed as 50% CGST and 50% SGST (for intra-state), states would directly receive 50% of the amount currently collected as cess on intra-state supplies as part of their SGST.
    *   If it's part of IGST (for inter-state), the amount would go into the central IGST pool and then be apportioned to the destination states or the Centre based on the rules, part of which goes to states.
    *   This would generally lead to an *increase* in the states' own direct GST revenue (SGST + IGST share) compared to the situation without compensation.
*   **End of Earmarked Fund:** The specific, earmarked fund for compensating states would cease to exist. States would no longer receive compensation payments for shortfalls below a guaranteed growth rate (unless a new mechanism is devised). Their revenue health would depend solely on the overall growth of GST collections and the sharing formula.
*   **Decision Making in GST Council:** The GST Council would need to decide *how* the cess is merged – whether it uniformly increases all rates by a certain percentage or leads to a rationalization of rates. The new effective rates and their split between CGST and SGST would determine the final revenue distribution.
*   **Potential Gain for States:** While losing the guarantee, states would gain a direct share of the revenue currently collected as cess, which might provide a more stable and buoyant revenue stream over the long term, integrated into the main GST structure rather than a separate compensation mechanism. This could particularly benefit states whose collections were strong enough that they received little or no compensation even under the old regime, as they would now get a share of the former cess revenue.

In essence, merging the cess would abolish the compensation system and integrate its revenue potential into the standard sharing framework, likely increasing states' direct share of GST revenue but removing the safety net of guaranteed growth.
