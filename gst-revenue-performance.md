### **18. What is meant by cascading effect of indirect taxation? Do you think Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India has eliminated the cascading effect? Explain your opinion. Mention the advantages of GST according to the advocates of GST in India? Discuss how the implementation of GST triggers inequality in our country. (2+2+3+3)**

**(a) Cascading Effect of Indirect Taxation (2 marks):**
The cascading effect, or 'tax-on-tax', is a phenomenon in a multi-stage indirect tax system where tax is levied on the value of a good or service at each stage of production and distribution, *without* allowing for credit of taxes paid at previous stages. This means that the tax base at each subsequent stage includes the tax paid at the preceding stage, leading to an artificial increase in the final price paid by the consumer and distortions in the production chain.

**(b) Elimination of Cascading Effect by GST (2 marks):**
Yes, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India is designed to largely eliminate the cascading effect. It achieves this through the comprehensive **Input Tax Credit (ITC)** mechanism. Under GST, a registered business paying tax on inputs (goods or services) used in their business activities can claim credit for that tax against their output tax liability. This ensures that tax is effectively levied only on the value addition at each stage, breaking the tax-on-tax chain that existed under the previous indirect tax regime (e.g., Central Excise Duty, State VAT, Service Tax). While the mechanism is largely successful, certain exceptions (like taxes on petroleum products outside GST, or businesses under composition scheme) might still exhibit some residual cascading.

**(c) Advantages of GST (3 marks):**
According to advocates, the key advantages of GST in India include:
*   **Elimination of Cascading Effect:** As discussed above, leading to a reduction in the overall tax burden on the supply chain and potentially lower prices for consumers.
*   **Creation of a Common National Market:** By subsuming multiple central and state taxes into a single tax, GST removes inter-state tax barriers (like Central Sales Tax, Entry Tax), facilitating seamless movement of goods and services across the country.
*   **Simplified Tax Structure:** Replaces numerous complex indirect taxes with a single, unified system with common procedures, forms, and compliance requirements.
*   **Increased Tax Base and Formalization:** The ITC mechanism incentivizes businesses to register and report transactions, bringing more economic activity into the formal sector and broadening the tax base.
*   **Improved Ease of Doing Business:** Reduces compliance costs and complexities for businesses operating across states.
*   **Boost to Exports:** Taxes on inputs used in exports are fully refundable under GST, making Indian exports more competitive in the international market.

**(d) GST Implementation and Inequality (3 marks):**
The implementation of GST can potentially trigger or exacerbate inequality in certain ways:
*   **Regressive Nature:** Like most indirect taxes, GST is inherently regressive in its impact. It is levied uniformly on consumption, regardless of income level. Poor households spend a larger proportion of their income on goods and services compared to rich households, meaning the tax burden as a percentage of income is higher for lower-income groups. While India has multiple GST rates and exemptions for essential goods, the overall structure still places a proportionally heavier burden on the poor.
*   **Compliance Burden on Small Businesses:** While GST aims for simplification, the digital compliance requirements (filing multiple monthly returns, matching invoices) can be burdensome for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), especially those in rural areas or with limited digital infrastructure and accounting expertise. This can increase their operating costs or push some towards the informal sector, while larger businesses with resources find it easier to comply.
*   **Impact on Specific Sectors/States:** The shift to a destination-based consumption tax model means that states that are net consumers benefit more in terms of revenue collection compared to states that are primarily producers or transit hubs, potentially affecting regional inequality in state finances.

These factors suggest that while GST brings macroeconomic efficiency gains, its microeconomic impact on income distribution and small businesses requires careful consideration and potentially targeted policy interventions.

### **19. Mention the central and state taxes subsumed under GST in India. Discuss how the introduction of GST accelerate the indirect tax collection in India during last five years. Is it stagflationary? Explain. In the context of GST illustrate the concept of revenue neutral tax rate and its implications in Indian economy. (2+2+2+4)**

**(a) Central and State Taxes Subsumed under GST in India (2 marks):**
As per Agarwal et al. (2024), the Goods and Services Tax (GST) subsumed a comprehensive set of indirect taxes previously levied by both the Central and State governments. These included:
*   **Central Taxes:** Central Excise Duty, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty, Special Additional Duty of Customs, and Central Surcharges and Cesses.
*   **State Taxes:** State VAT (Value Added Tax), Sales Tax, Central Sales Tax, Purchase Tax, Luxury Tax, Entertainment Tax, Entry Tax, Taxes on Advertisements, and Taxes on Lotteries, Betting, and Gambling (Agarwal et al., 2024, fn. 6).

**(b) How the Introduction of GST Accelerated Indirect Tax Collection (2 marks):**
Agarwal et al. (2024) provide a nuanced perspective on GST's revenue performance. While initial reports might suggest an acceleration in collections, particularly as monthly collections grew from ₹1 lakh crore to ₹1.8 lakh crore and crossed ₹2 lakh crore in April 2024 (Page 2), the authors clarify that this impression primarily stems from *gross* collections.

The paper argues that in terms of *net revenues* (gross collections less refunds to taxpayers), the overall revenues have "only now, after seven years of its implementation, converged to pre-GST levels" (Page 3). The *net revenue-to-GDP ratio* actually "fell steadily through FY21 and then slowly began to increase, but still as of FY24 was only barely back to pre-GST levels" (Page 2, Figure 2). This disappointing overall collection performance is attributed significantly to "rate cutting that has happened, especially between 2017 and 2019" (Page 3), along with cuts as an emergency measure during the pandemic.

Therefore, the article suggests that rather than accelerating indirect tax collection, GST has primarily managed to *sustain* government revenue at pre-GST levels despite rate reductions, supported by improvements in collection efficiency and favourable composition effects (e.g., towards imports and high-taxed goods like SUVs) (Page 3-4).

**(c) Is it Stagflationary? (2 marks):**
Agarwal et al. (2024) do not explicitly use the term "stagflationary" to describe the impact of GST. However, their analysis provides insights into economic conditions relevant to the concept:
*   **Stagnation/Weak Growth:** The paper notes that "consumption growth has been quite weak in recent quarters" (Page 9), despite GST rate cuts which should theoretically boost consumption by lowering prices. Furthermore, the overall GST revenue performance, especially in terms of net revenues, did not meet initial "enormous revenue bounty" predictions and only recently converged to pre-GST levels (Page 1, 3). This suggests a lack of significant growth impetus from GST on the revenue side, and weak consumption growth in the broader economy.
*   **Inflation:** The article does not discuss GST as a direct cause of inflation. In fact, it highlights "rate cutting" as a key feature of the GST regime (Page 1, 3), which would typically have a disinflationary effect on prices. The paper notes that rates were reduced on various goods like electric appliances, mobile phones, and cosmetics (Page 3), benefiting consumers.

In summary, while the article points to aspects of economic stagnation (weak consumption growth, disappointing revenue buoyancy despite rate cuts), it does not suggest that GST itself has caused inflation or contributed to a stagflationary environment. Rather, it focuses on the revenue implications of rate cuts and broader economic trends.

**(d) Revenue Neutral Tax Rate (RNR) and its Implications in Indian Economy (4 marks):**
**Concept of Revenue Neutral Tax Rate (RNR):**
In the context of GST, the Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) refers to a single or a set of rates that, if implemented, would ensure that the total tax revenue collected under the new tax regime (GST) remains approximately the same as the revenue collected from the taxes it replaces (the pre-GST system) (Agarwal et al., 2024, Page 2). The objective of an RNR is to transition to a new tax structure without causing an immediate loss or gain in government revenue. Agarwal et al. (2024) specifically mention the RNR report of 2015, suggesting a rate of 12%-15% if the compensation cess were folded into the regular rate structure (Page 9).

**Implications in Indian Economy (as discussed in the article):**
The article advocates for folding the compensation cess into the regular GST rate structure at a rate consistent with the RNR principle, highlighting several implications for the Indian economy:
1.  **Revenue Stability and Fiscal Certainty:** Implementing the RNR ensures that "no state would experience a decline in revenues from current levels" and "no additional fiscal burden arises" (Page 2, 9). This provides fiscal stability for both the Union and the states, crucial for government functioning and development plans.
2.  **Benefit to Poorer States:** A significant implication is that if the cess is folded into the regular GST rate structure at RNR, "the biggest benefits would accrue to the states that need it most: the poorer ones" (Page 2). This is because GST, being a consumption-based tax, generates more revenue for populous (often poorer) states, a shift from the previous production-based indirect tax regime which accrued more to richer, producing states (Page 2).
3.  **Elimination of Revenue Guarantees:** By ensuring adequate revenue for states, folding the cess into the RNR-based rate structure means "revenue guarantees for the states may not be necessary" (Page 1). This is critical as the compensation mechanism has ended, and its continuation led to moral hazard (states voting for rate cuts without bearing consequences) (Page 11).
4.  **Simplification of Tax Structure:** The current compensation cess structure is "monstrously complicated" (Page 9). Integrating it into a simplified RNR-based rate structure would streamline the GST system, making it more efficient and easier to administer (Page 9).
5.  **Discouraging "De-merit" Goods:** The cess is currently levied on "de-merit goods" (e.g., tobacco, aerated drinks, motor vehicles) which the government aims to discourage (Page 2, 9). Folding the cess into the regular rate structure at RNR allows the government to maintain higher taxation on these goods without losing revenue or having to tax other goods it does not wish to discourage (Page 9).

### **20. Discuss the major reforms in India’s indirect tax system since 1950s. Examine the overall revenue performance of GST in recent years. (5+5)**

**(a) Major Reforms in India’s Indirect Tax System Since 1950s (5 marks):**
India's indirect tax system has undergone significant structural changes since independence, moving from a fragmented, origin-based system towards a more unified, destination-based consumption tax:
*   **Early Post-Independence (1950s-1960s):** Characterized by a mix of Central Excise Duties (mainly on manufactured goods) and State Sales Taxes. Sales taxes were origin-based for inter-state trade (Central Sales Tax - CST, introduced in 1956) and destination-based within states (State Sales Tax/VAT). This system suffered from cascading and complexity.
*   **Introduction of MODVAT/CENVAT (1980s-1990s):** Recognizing the cascading effect of Excise Duty, the Modified Value Added Tax (MODVAT) was introduced in 1986, initially for selected commodities, allowing manufacturers to claim credit for excise paid on inputs. This was later expanded and renamed CENVAT (Central Value Added Tax) in 2000, covering more goods and extending credit across stages of manufacturing. This was a crucial step towards a VAT system at the central level.
*   **Introduction of Service Tax (1994):** Service Tax was introduced on a limited set of services and gradually expanded to cover almost all services by the early 2000s. This was a significant expansion of the central tax base, but the lack of seamless credit between CENVAT (on goods) and Service Tax (on services) perpetuated some cascading.
*   **Implementation of State VATs (Early 2000s):** States began replacing their cascading State Sales Taxes with a Value Added Tax (VAT) system, largely between 2003 and 2006. State VAT was destination-based within the state and allowed credit for tax paid on inputs within the state. However, CST on inter-state sales remained a major source of cascading and inhibited a national market.
*   **The Journey to GST (Late 2000s - 2017):** The idea of a unified Goods and Services Tax was mooted to subsume CENVAT, Service Tax, State VATs, CST, and other levies, thereby creating a national VAT and a common market. This required complex negotiations between the Centre and states on rate structures, administration, and compensation. The 101st Constitutional Amendment paved the way, and GST was finally implemented on July 1, 2017. GST is a dual VAT model, with simultaneous levy of Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST) on intra-state supplies, and Integrated GST (IGST) on inter-state supplies and imports.

**(b) Overall Revenue Performance of GST in Recent Years (5 marks):**
Agarwal et al. (2024) critically examine the overall revenue performance of GST over its first seven years (FY18-FY24), presenting several key findings:

1.  **Disappointing Overall Bounty:** The initial predictions of an "enormous revenue bounty from the GST have not been realised" (Page 1). The authors contend that "overall revenues have only now converged to pre-GST levels" (Page 1).

2.  **Gross vs. Net Revenue Discrepancy:** While media reports often highlight high monthly gross collections (e.g., ₹1.8-₹2 lakh crore), giving an "impression that the GST has produced an enormous and growing revenue bounty" (Page 2), the authors emphasize the importance of looking at *net revenues* (gross collections minus refunds). The net revenue-to-GDP ratio "fell steadily through FY21 and then slowly began to increase, but still as of FY24 was only barely back to pre-GST levels" (Page 2-3, Figure 2).

3.  **Significant Refunds:** Refunds are identified as a major factor explaining the difference between gross and net revenues. They are "non-trivial in magnitude, persistently hovering around 0.6%-0.7% of GDP and declining to 0.4% in FY24" (Page 3). These refunds are primarily due to the zero-rating of exports in GST, meaning exporters are entitled to refunds on taxes paid on their inputs, especially on imported inputs (Page 3).

4.  **Impact of Rate Cuts:** A significant reason for the "disappointing overall collections" and the failure to surpass pre-GST revenue levels is attributed to "rate cutting that has happened, especially between 2017 and 2019" (Page 1, 3). Rates were reduced on numerous goods in the run-up to the 2019 elections and as an emergency measure during the pandemic, actions that have "still not been reversed" (Page 1, 3). Estimates suggest the effective tax rate declined from 13.2% to 10.8% (Page 3).

5.  **Positive Compositional Effects and Efficiency Gains:** Despite the challenges, the authors note some positive aspects. GST has "managed to sustain government revenue, even as rates have been reduced, benefiting consumers" (Page 3). This is partly due to "improvements in collection efficiency and favourable composition effects—towards imports and towards high-taxed goods" (Page 3-4). For instance, a shift in automobile sales from regular cars to SUVs (which attract a higher GST rate of ~50% compared to ~35%) contributed significantly to revenue buoyancy (Page 4).

In essence, while GST has shown resilience in sustaining revenues amidst rate cuts and pandemic disruptions, its overall revenue performance, when accounting for net collections and comparing it to the pre-GST era, has not delivered the anticipated "bounty" and has only recently converged to previous levels.

### **21. Compare the evolution of GST revenue for the state governments and the union government in India during the GST with compensation regime. Mention the indication of the revenue performance of the union and the state governments in the regime of GST without compensation. The GST council is yet to decide about the compensation cess. Analyse how the distribution of revenues among the centre and the states would be affected if the compensation cess become a part of the regular rate structure of GST. (4+2+4)**

**(a) Evolution of GST Revenue During the GST with Compensation Regime (FY18-FY22) (4 marks):**
The "GST with compensation regime" (Transition Regime I, FY18-FY22) was characterized by a generous compensation mechanism designed to reassure states about revenue losses post-GST implementation (Agarwal et al., 2024, Page 4).

*   **States' Revenue Performance:**
    *   **Fiscal Bonanza:** States experienced a "fiscal bonanza" during this period (Page 1). Their GST/GDP ratio "increased substantially" (Page 5, Figure 4) due to the 14% annual revenue growth guarantee compounded from a pre-GST 2015-16 base (Page 4).
    *   **Net Gains:** On average, states gained about "0.2 percentage points of GDP every year" relative to the pre-GST regime (Page 6, Benchmark 1). If only the guarantee period (FY18-FY22) is considered, the bounty for states was even higher, at about 0.3% of GDP (Page 6).
    *   **Variation and Beneficiaries:** The fiscal bounty varied widely. Poorer states with "weak growth" (e.g., Rajasthan, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Goa) generally accrued "large windfalls from the compensation mechanism" (Page 2, 7, Figure 6), as the guarantee outpaced their nominal GSDP growth (Page 8). Some states, like Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, incurred nominal losses compared to their FY12-17 average due to the specific FY16 base year for compensation calculation (Page 7).
    *   **Mechanism:** Compensation was funded by a special "compensation cess" levied on "de-merit goods" and "luxury goods" (Page 4). When the pandemic hit, substantial borrowing (₹2.7 lakh crore) was undertaken by the Union on behalf of the states to meet the guarantee shortfalls, further expanding the pie for states (Page 4, 6).

*   **Union Government's Revenue Performance:**
    *   **Significant Sacrifice:** In stark contrast to the states, the Union government made "significant revenue sacrifices" (Page 7). It "forewent up to 1% of gross domestic product in GST revenues for each of the seven years" (Page 1, Abstract).
    *   **Net Losses:** The Union's relevant tax-to-GDP ratio declined by 0.6 percentage points on average (Page 6, Benchmark 1). The Union's share of total GST revenues was reduced from nearly 51% in the pre-GST era to 44% during the transition (Page 6).
    *   **Reasons for Loss:** The compensation guarantee alone cost the Union 5.5 percentage points of the kitty. Additionally, a "quirk of the design"—where Input Tax Credits (ITC) and refunds are primarily applied against the Union's share of collections—cost the Union another 1.5 percentage points (Page 6).
    *   **Cooperative Federalism:** This sacrifice by the Union, often overlooked, is highlighted as "testament to the remarkable spirit of cooperative federalism that characterised the GST's design" (Page 2, 7).

**(b) Indication of Revenue Performance in the GST without Compensation Regime (FY23-FY25) (2 marks):**
The "GST without compensation regime" (Transition Regime II, FY23-FY25) commenced as the 14% guarantee ended in July 2022, with cess revenues subsequently earmarked for loan repayment (Agarwal et al., 2024, Page 4).

*   **States' Revenue Performance:** States experienced a "sharp drop in GST revenues, starting in FY23" (Page 2) as compensation ceased. Their GST/GDP ratio "declined in FY23 and FY24" (Page 5, Figure 4). However, a widespread "fiscal cliff" was largely "avoided because at the same time the pandemic ended and activity rebounded, triggering a surge in revenues from other taxes" (Page 2). Despite this, states' GST revenues peaked in FY22 (3.7% of GDP) and "have since declined to 2.8% in FY24" (Page 7).

*   **Union Government's Revenue Performance:** The Union's revenues, which had declined until FY22, "then registered a steady increase" from FY23 onwards (Page 5, Figure 4). This improvement was attributed to a "significant improvement in net revenue performance" (Page 5). Despite the divergent trends, both the Union and the states faced a common challenge from the "loss of compensation revenues" (Page 5).

**(c) Analysis of Revenue Distribution if Compensation Cess Becomes Part of Regular Rate Structure (4 marks):**
The GST Council faces a critical decision regarding the compensation cess, which currently fetches "no less than 7%-8% of overall GST revenues" or "over 0.5% of GDP" and is used for loan repayment (Agarwal et al., 2024, Page 5, 9). The paper strongly advocates for folding the cess into the regular rate structure, ideally at a single Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) of 12%-15% (Page 9). This would significantly affect revenue distribution:

1.  **Shift in Union-State Distribution:** Currently, the cess is primarily used to repay pandemic loans, meaning neither the Union nor the states receive direct revenue from it (Page 9). Once these loans are repaid, if the cess is integrated into the regular rate structure, its collections (around 0.5% of GDP) "would instead be shared 50:50 between the union and the states" (Page 9). This means *both* the Union and the states "will see an increase in their revenues" (Page 5, 9).

2.  **Shift in Inter-State Distribution:** The distribution of revenues *among* states would also change profoundly. Instead of being allocated based on shortfalls from the 14% guarantee, revenues from the cess (now part of the regular GST) would be distributed based on "consumption levels of the affected goods" (Page 9).
    *   **Benefit to Poorer, Consuming States:** The authors predict that "the biggest benefits would accrue to the states that need it most: the poorer ones" (Page 2). This is because GST is a consumption-based tax, which inherently benefits more populous (and often poorer) states, unlike the previous production-based taxes (Page 2, 9). Figures 10 and 11 in the article illustrate that poorer states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan would be significant gainers under this steady-state scenario (Page 10).
    *   **Overall State Gain:** The analysis suggests that under this proposed structure, "states as a whole and nearly all states individually will see an increase in revenues from current levels" (Page 9).

3.  **No Need for Future Guarantees and Reduced Moral Hazard:** Integrating the cess into the regular rate structure at an RNR would ensure sufficient revenue for states, making future revenue guarantees unnecessary (Page 2, 9). This would also address the "moral hazard" issue observed during the compensation regime, where states could vote for rate cuts in the GST Council knowing their revenues were guaranteed (Page 11).

In essence, this reform would normalize a significant revenue stream, distribute it equitably between the Union and states, and reallocate state shares based on consumption, favoring poorer states and removing the need for ad-hoc compensation mechanisms.
