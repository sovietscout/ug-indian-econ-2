### **21. Compare the evolution of GST revenue for the state governments and the union government in India during the GST with compensation regime. Mention the indication of the revenue performance of the union and the state governments in the regime of GST without compensation. The GST council is yet to decide about the compensation cess. Analyse how the distribution of revenues among the centre and the states would be affected if the compensation cess become a part of the regular rate structure of GST. (4+2+4)**

**(a) Evolution of GST Revenue during the GST with Compensation Regime (FY18-FY22) (Approx. 4 marks):**
During the initial GST with compensation regime (FY2018-FY2022), as discussed by Agarwal et al. (2024, p. 4, Figure 4):
*   **State Governments:** States were provided a generous compensation mechanism, guaranteeing their revenue would grow at 14% annually, compounded from an agreed pre-GST (2015-16) base (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 4). To fund this, a compensation cess was levied on "de-merit" and luxury goods. As a result, states experienced a "fiscal bonanza," with their GST/GDP ratio increasing substantially. Figure 4 shows a clear rise in state revenues (R+C) from around 3.2% of GDP in the pre-GST period to peaks of 3.6-3.7% during this compensation phase (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 5). This mechanism largely insulated states from revenue shortfalls, even when overall GST collections fell short of projections.
*   **Union Government:** In contrast, the union government bore the brunt of the compensation mechanism. Its revenue (R) declined until FY22, falling from approximately 3.1% of GDP in the pre-GST period to around 2.6% in FY20/21 (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 5). The union received "virtually nothing" from the compensation cess fund because economic growth and revenues fell short of projections, leading to significant revenue sacrifices by the union to reassure risk-averse states and ensure GST implementation (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 4, 7). The pandemic further exacerbated this, necessitating the union to borrow substantially (â‚¹2.7 lakh crore) on behalf of states to meet the guarantee (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 4).

**(b) Revenue Performance without Compensation Regime (FY23 onwards) (Approx. 2 marks):**
Following the expiration of the 14% compensation guarantee in July 2022 (marking the transition to the GST without compensation regime, FY23 onwards), Agarwal et al. (2024, p. 5, Figure 4) observe a shift in revenue performance:
*   **State Governments:** States experienced a sharp drop in their GST revenues (R), moving from a regime with compensation (R+C) to one without (R). Their GST/GDP ratio declined from the peak of 3.7% in FY22 to approximately 2.8% in FY24 (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 5). This posed a "fiscal cliff" for many states, though the rebound in economic activity post-pandemic mitigated a more severe crisis (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 2, 5).
*   **Union Government:** Conversely, the union government's revenues (R) registered a "steady increase" post-FY22 (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 5). This improvement was partly due to a significant betterment in its net revenue performance, as the funds from the compensation cess (which were previously diverted) became available for repaying the pandemic loans (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 5).

**(c) Impact of Merging Compensation Cess into Regular GST Rate Structure (Approx. 4 marks):**
The GST Council faces the decision of what to do with the compensation cess as its primary rationale (funding temporary guarantees) has ended. Agarwal et al. (2024, p. 9) analyze the implications if the cess were folded into the regular GST rate structure:
*   **Rationalization and Absorption:** The authors propose that the cess should be drastically rationalized, possibly reduced to a single rate (e.g., 12%-15% as per the RNR report of 2015), and absorbed into the regular GST rate structure without imposing an additional fiscal burden.
*   **Shift in Distribution Between Union and States:**
    1.  **Overall Share:** The existing cess collections (which amount to roughly 0.5% of GDP and are currently used for loan repayment) would no longer be exclusively for the states (as compensation) but would be shared 50:50 between the union and the states, just like other GST revenues (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 9). This would significantly increase the revenue available to both the union and states, as these funds would transition from debt servicing to budgetary allocation.
    2.  **Among States:** The distribution of revenues *among states* would change. Instead of being allocated based on revenue shortfalls from the 14% guarantee, revenues derived from the erstwhile cess would be distributed based on the consumption levels of the affected goods in each state (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 9).
*   **Projected Outcomes:** The analysis suggests that this change would lead to a revenue increase for states as a whole, and for "nearly all states individually," even if overall GST revenues remain at current levels. The union government would also gain (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 9). This is because the overall "kitty" of distributable revenue would expand by the amount of the cess once the loans are repaid. Broadly, this scenario is expected to benefit poorer states (e.g., Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan) the most, as GST, being consumption-based with centralized IGST collection, inherently favors more populous and consuming states (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 10-11). The authors conclude that "no state will really lose" under this proposed structure (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 9).
