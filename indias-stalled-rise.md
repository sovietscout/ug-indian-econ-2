### **4. What do you mean by “New Welfarism” approach to development? Give a brief account of the achievements of the “New Welfarism” approach to development in India. Discuss the merits and demerits of national champion approach for accelerating economic growth in India. (2+3+5 Marks)**

**Definition of "New Welfarism" (2 Marks)**
Subramanian and Felman (2022) describe the "New Welfarism" adopted by the Modi government since 2015 as a distinctive approach to redistributive development. Unlike traditional social spending focused on intangible public goods like health and education, this approach prioritizes investment in programs providing tangible basic goods and services directly to citizens, often with a focus on women. Key examples cited include the provision of bank accounts, cooking gas, toilets, electricity, housing, water, and direct cash transfers. It represents a shift towards tangible private benefits delivered publicly, aiming for more visible and potentially more efficient distribution compared to traditional welfare mechanisms.

**Achievements of "New Welfarism" (3 Marks)**
According to Subramanian and Felman (2022), the achievements of this New Welfarism strategy, while sometimes overstated, are significant:
1. **Improved Access to Basic Amenities:** By 2019, household access to electricity reportedly rose to 98% (from 75% a decade prior), and 60% gained access to clean cooking gas.
2. **Financial Inclusion:** Survey data indicated that nearly three-quarters of Indian women possessed bank accounts they could personally operate.
3. **Efficient Subsidy Delivery:** Government subsidies to the poor, previously notorious for "leakage," are now largely delivered via direct cash payments, totaling approximately $100 billion per year, ensuring they reach intended beneficiaries more effectively.
These achievements form a key component of the government's improved "hardware" – the basic infrastructure and services underpinning the economy and potentially contributing to political stability.

**Merits and Demerits of the National Champion Approach (5 Marks)**
The article discusses the Modi government's industrial policy featuring the promotion of "national champions," specifically referencing large conglomerates like the Adani Group and Reliance Industries ("the 2As"). This strategy has potential merits but also significant drawbacks:
**Merits:**
1. **Economies of Scale and Network Effects:** As seen in historical examples like Japan's *zaibatsu* and South Korea's *chaebol*, government support can enable favored firms to achieve significant economies of scale and create extensive networks (Subramanian and Felman, 2022, p. 7).
2. **Pursuit of National Goals:** Large, resource-rich champions can be directed towards national objectives. The article cites Reliance Jio's rollout of a low-cost 4G network, significantly expanding internet access, and the potential for both conglomerates to drive investments in renewables to meet climate goals (p. 7).
3. **Enhanced Global Position:** Theoretically, strong national champions can bolster a country's competitiveness in the global marketplace.
**Demerits:**
4. **Stifling Competition and Innovation:** Favoring specific firms through regulations or contracts can disadvantage competitors, hindering investment and innovation. The article notes the financial struggles of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone during Jio's expansion, regulatory hurdles for potential e-commerce competitors (Amazon, Tata, Walmart), and disadvantages for garment exporters due to policies favoring Reliance's fiber production (p. 8).
5. **Oligopolistic Market Structure:** The strategy risks creating an oligopolistic economy, particularly as the "2As" operate heavily in domestic infrastructure sectors shielded from international competition and subject to government regulation. This concentration of economic power can stifle broader growth (p. 8).
6. **Undermining Investment Climate:** While some policies aim to improve the investment climate, the favoritism inherent in the national champions strategy may undermine these efforts by creating an uneven playing field and policy uncertainty for other domestic and foreign firms (p. 8).
7. **Risk of "Stigmatized Capitalism":** This approach may reinforce public perception of "stigmatized capitalism," where success is seen as stemming from proximity to power and manipulation of rules rather than pure market competition, potentially eroding public support for market-based reforms (pp. 8-9).
8. **Inefficiency Concerns:** Unlike the *zaibatsu* and *chaebol* which operated significantly in tradable sectors requiring global competitiveness, the focus of the "2As" on regulated domestic sectors reduces the pressure for efficiency (p. 8).

Subramanian and Felman (2022) conclude that the negative effects, particularly the discouragement of wider investment and the potential for an entrenched oligopoly, likely outweigh the benefits, posing a significant risk to India's long-term growth prospects.

### **5. Mention the recent government’s initiatives to grow the private sector. Do the initiatives satisfy the aspiration of young Indians? What is meant by stigmatised capitalism? Do you think that recent public policies encourage stigmatised capitalism in a new variant? Argue. (3+2+2+3 Marks)**

**Recent Government Initiatives for the Private Sector (3 Marks)**
Subramanian and Felman (2022, p. 5) highlight several recent government initiatives aimed at improving the "policy software" and fostering private sector growth:
1. **Corporate Tax Reduction:** In 2019, the general corporate tax rate was lowered from 35% to 25%, with new manufacturing firms offered a potentially lower rate of 15%.
2. **Resolution of Tax Disputes:** The government moved to settle long-standing, controversial retrospective tax disputes, notably with foreign firms like Cairn Energy and Vodafone, amounting to nearly $7 billion.
3. **Privatization:** The government privatized the national airline, Air India, selling it back to its original owner, the Tata Group, after 68 years of state ownership.
4. **Planned Reforms:** The article also mentions ambitious reforms in the pipeline, including plans to monetize other public-sector assets, liberalize the farm economy (though subsequently withdrawn after protests), and reform complex labor laws.

**Satisfaction of Youth Aspirations (2 Marks)**
Subramanian and Felman (2022) argue that these initiatives, particularly the industrial policy linked to them (like the Production-Linked Incentives or PLIs), may *not* adequately satisfy the aspirations of young Indians. Their reasoning is:
* India has a large, young population needing gainful employment, primarily for low-skilled workers seeking rising wages. The authors suggest India needs to follow the "Asian recipe of boosting labor-intensive exports" (p. 6).
* However, the government's industrial strategy, including PLIs, is perceived as favouring technology and capital-intensive sectors (e.g., cell phones, electronics), which are expected to "provide relatively few jobs for the bulk of the population" (p. 7).
* Therefore, there appears to be a mismatch between the type of growth potentially spurred by some recent policies and the labor-intensive job creation needed by India's youth demographic.

**Meaning of Stigmatized Capitalism (2 Marks)**
As explained by Subramanian and Felman (2022, p. 8), "stigmatized capitalism" refers to the deep ambivalence and mistrust many Indians hold towards the private sector and capitalism itself. This stigma originates from the historical experience of the "license raj," an era perceived to be rife with corruption where business success often depended on manipulating complex regulations and tariffs. It also encompasses periods like the pre-2008 infrastructure boom, associated with the "rent raj," where private firms allegedly captured public resources (land, coal, spectrum) through political connections. The core idea is a perception that private wealth accumulation is often linked to cronyism and unfair advantages rather than genuine innovation and efficiency.

**Recent Policies and Stigmatized Capitalism (3 Marks)**
Subramanian and Felman (2022) argue compellingly that recent public policies *do* encourage a new variant of stigmatized capitalism. Their argument rests on the following points:
1.  **Favoritism towards "National Champions":** The current government's strategy explicitly promotes specific large conglomerates (the "2As"). This is achieved through "regulatory favors and privileged access to infrastructure contracts" (p. 9).
2.  **"The 2A Variant":** The authors explicitly label this phenomenon as "stigmatized capitalism, the 2A variant" (p. 9), suggesting it is a continuation or evolution of the historical problem, where proximity to the current government, rather than the old license bureaucracy, confers advantage.
3.  **Erosion of Public Trust:** This perceived favoritism undermines public support for market-based reforms. The authors cite the farmer protests against agricultural liberalization as evidence: a key reason for opposition was the fear that the reforms would lead to an oligopoly dominated by the "2As," disadvantaging farmers (p. 9). This demonstrates how policies seen as benefiting select players rekindle public suspicion.
4.  **Contrast with IT Boom:** This contrasts sharply with the 1990s IT boom, which helped cleanse the private sector's image precisely because it "developed by virtue of its distance from, rather than proximity to, the government" (p. 9).

Therefore, by concentrating economic power and opportunities in the hands of a few favored players, recent policies risk intensifying, rather than alleviating, the problem of stigmatized capitalism, hindering the development of broad-based trust in market mechanisms.
