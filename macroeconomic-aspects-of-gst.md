### **18. What is meant by cascading effect of indirect taxation? Do you think Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India has eliminated the cascading effect? Explain your opinion. Mention the advantages of GST according to the advocates of GST in India? Discuss how the implementation of GST triggers inequality in our country. (2+2+3+3)**

**(a) Cascading Effect of Indirect Taxation (2 marks):**
As explained by Arun Kumar (2015), the cascading effect in indirect taxation refers to the phenomenon where taxes are levied on taxes at different stages of production and distribution. This occurs when a tax is applied to the value of a good or service, and then a subsequent tax is levied on this already taxed value (including the previous tax). Kumar (2015, p. 3) notes two components: "tax on tax" and "profit on tax" within a markup pricing system, both of which lead to an increase in profits and the effective rate of indirect taxes, ultimately raising prices for consumers through the chain of production.

**(b) Elimination of Cascading Effect by GST (2 marks):**
Based on Kumar (2015), the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India has **reduced** the cascading effect, but **not eliminated** it entirely.
*   **Mechanism of Reduction:** GST, being a value-added tax (VAT), is designed to allow input tax credit (ITC) for taxes paid on inputs at previous stages. This mechanism is intended to remove the "tax on tax" component, as businesses can offset the tax paid on their purchases against the tax collected on their sales (Kumar, 2015, p. 4).
*   **Reasons for Non-Elimination:** Kumar (2015, p. 5) argues that for the cascading effect to be fully eliminated, the *entire chain of production and distribution* must be brought under the GST net. However, the current GST proposal in India includes "special provisions for petroleum, tobacco, and alcohol" which, due to their significant revenue contribution, may remain outside the GST framework. If these large segments are not covered, the cascading effect will persist for goods and services utilizing them as inputs (Kumar, 2015, p. 5). Furthermore, Kumar (2015, p. 6) concludes that "given the structure of GST being adopted, the cascading effect will be reduced but not eliminated."

**(c) Advantages of GST According to its Advocates (3 marks):**
According to Arun Kumar (2015, p. 2), the proponents of GST in India advocate for it based on several projected macroeconomic benefits, billing it as the "biggest reform in India's taxation" and a "win-win situation for all stakeholders." These advantages include:
*   **Seamless, Unified Market:** Creating a single, unified market across the country for businesses.
*   **GDP Growth:** Boosting Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth by an estimated 1% to 2%.
*   **Improved Tax-GDP Ratio:** Increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio by 2%.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Reducing the cost of indigenous goods by around 10%.
*   **Impact on Black Economy:** Positively impacting the black economy.
*   **Consolidation and Economies of Scale:** Leading to the consolidation of manufacturing, allowing industries to reap economies of scale.

**(d) How Implementation of GST Triggers Inequality (3 marks):**
Arun Kumar (2015) highlights several ways in which the implementation of GST can exacerbate inequality in India:
*   **Disadvantage to Small-Scale and Unorganised Sector:** Kumar (2015, p. 2) explicitly states that while large-scale producers benefit, "the small-scale ones will be at a greater disadvantage than before." This is because GST (as a form of VAT) requires detailed account keeping for input costs and revenue, which is difficult and expensive for small and micro businesses, especially those in the unorganized sector that do not maintain such records (Kumar, 2015, p. 3, 4). The need for computerization for compliance further burdens these smaller units.
*   **Marginalisation of Small-Scale Sector:** Historically, the small-scale sector benefited from reservations and exemptions from indirect taxes. With the shift to VAT/GST, large businesses, including multinational corporations, saw an advantage as it would lead to the marginalization of the small-scale sector, which would find it harder to compete (Kumar, 2015, p. 3).
*   **Regressive Nature of Indirect Taxes:** Kumar (2015, p. 3) notes that indirect taxes generally "tend to be regressive," meaning they disproportionately affect lower-income groups as they are levied on consumption rather than income. Even if luxuries are taxed higher than necessities, the overall regressivity remains because the definition is with respect to income. If GST leads to an increase in the indirect tax-to-GDP ratio, it can strengthen these regressive conditions.
*   **Inflationary Pressure on Basic Goods:** Kumar (2015, p. 4) argues that adopting a fixed Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) across all stages of production means prices of "basic and intermediate goods" will rise, while final prices may not fall. This impacts the poor disproportionately, as a larger share of their expenditure goes towards basic necessities.

### **19. Mention the central and state taxes subsumed under GST in India. Discuss how the introduction of GST accelerate the indirect tax collection in India during last five years. Is it stagflationary? Explain. In the context of GST illustrate the concept of revenue neutral tax rate and its implications in Indian economy. (2+2+2+4)**

**(a) Central and State Taxes Subsumed Under GST (2 marks):**
According to Agarwal et al. (2024, fn. 6), the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India subsumed a comprehensive set of indirect taxes previously levied by both the central and state governments. These include:
*   **Central Taxes:** Central Excise Duty, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty (CVD), Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD), Central Surcharges and Cesses.
*   **State Taxes:** State VAT (Value Added Tax), Sales Tax, Central Sales Tax (CST), Purchase Tax, Luxury Tax, Entertainment Tax, Entry Tax, Taxes on Advertisements, and Taxes on Lotteries, Betting, and Gambling.

**(b) Acceleration of Indirect Tax Collection under GST (2 marks):**
Agarwal et al. (2024) observe that, in terms of gross collections, the introduction of GST has shown a significant acceleration in indirect tax collection, especially in recent years. The paper notes that monthly GST collections initially averaged around ₹1 lakh crore, progressively increasing to ₹1.5 lakh crore, then ₹1.8 lakh crore, and even crossing ₹2 lakh crore in April 2024. As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the gross GST collections matched pre-GST levels from the outset, dipped during the pandemic, but subsequently "soared to levels that are significantly higher than under the previous regime" (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 2). This surge, despite rate cuts, is attributed to improvements in collection efficiency and favourable composition effects, such as a shift towards imports and high-taxed goods (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 3).

**(c) Is GST Stagflationary? (2 marks):**
Arun Kumar (2015) argues that indirect taxes, being a prime cost, are inherently stagflationary. Drawing on Kalecki (1971), Kumar (2015, p. 2) explains that, *ceteris paribus*, indirect taxes lead to a rise in prices while output stagnates (due to their impact on demand). Therefore, if the introduction of GST leads to an increase in the indirect tax-to-GDP ratio, it would consequently result in an increase in the rate of inflation. This contradicts the microeconomic argument that GST would lead to lower prices and benefit consumers (Kumar, 2015, p. 3). While Agarwal et al. (2024) note that rate cuts under GST were intended to benefit consumers, the underlying macroeconomic concerns regarding the inflationary potential if the tax-GDP ratio rises remain, aligning with the stagflationary hypothesis put forth by Kumar (2015).

**(d) Revenue Neutral Tax Rate (RNR) and its Implications (4 marks):**
Arun Kumar (2015, p. 4) defines the Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) in the context of GST (a form of VAT) as the fixed tax rate (Tᵢ) that would need to be applied to the value added (Vᵢ) at a given stage of production to collect the same amount of revenue as was previously collected from an ad valorem tax (tᵢ) on the gross output (Oᵢ). Mathematically, if Oᵢ\*tᵢ = Vᵢ\*Tᵢ, then Tᵢ = (Oᵢ/Vᵢ)\*tᵢ. Since value added (Vᵢ) is always less than gross output (Oᵢ), the ratio (Oᵢ/Vᵢ) is greater than 1, implying that the RNR (Tᵢ) must be higher than the previous ad valorem tax rate (tᵢ).

**Implications for the Indian Economy:**
*   **Progressively Higher Rates:** Kumar (2015, p. 4) highlights that the more subsequent the stage of production, the larger the gap between output and value added (Oᵢ/Vᵢ). Consequently, the RNR would have to be progressively higher at later stages for revenue neutrality at each stage.
*   **Price Increases:** If a constant RNR is adopted across all stages of production and distribution, it would lead to a rise in prices for basic and intermediate goods. Although the final price might remain unchanged in the aggregate (assuming revenue neutrality is achieved in aggregate), the increases in input costs would exert inflationary pressure on the economy (Kumar, 2015, p. 4).
*   **No Price Decline:** Kumar (2015, p. 4) contends that if revenue neutrality is the objective, the cascading effect might be reduced, but prices will not fall, nor will profits decline, contradicting the claims of GST proponents that it would benefit consumers through lower prices. This also means exporters might not benefit due to unchanged costs.
*   **Impact on Services:** As GST covers more goods and services and subsumes taxes like luxury tax and cess, the RNR has to be higher overall. Since services previously did not pay sales tax, their prices would rise sharply under the RNR framework (Kumar, 2015, p. 4).
*   **Complexity and Controversy:** The calculation of a precise RNR is difficult and controversial due to the variety of taxes being replaced and the need for accurate data on costs and revenues, which is often challenging for the unorganized sector (Kumar, 2015, p. 4).

### **20. Discuss the major reforms in India’s indirect tax system since 1950s. Examine the overall revenue performance of GST in recent years. (5+5)**

**(a) Major Reforms in India's Indirect Tax System since the 1950s (Approx. 5 marks):**
Arun Kumar (2015, pp. 3-4) outlines the historical evolution and major reforms in India's indirect tax system:
*   **Early Era (1950s onwards):** Initially, most indirect taxes were "specific" in nature, meaning they were levied as a fixed amount per unit of a good. While easier to implement, these taxes lacked buoyancy, necessitating frequent changes in tax rates to keep pace with economic growth and inflation.
*   **Shift to Ad Valorem Taxes:** Over time, there was a transition to "ad valorem" taxes, which are levied as a percentage of the value of goods. These taxes are more buoyant, as revenue automatically increases with inflation or rising goods values. However, ad valorem taxes introduced the problem of a "cascading effect," where taxes were levied on taxes, leading to an increase in the effective tax rate and higher prices (Kumar, 2015, p. 3).
*   **Introduction of MODVAT/CENVAT:** To address the cascading effect, the concept of Value Added Tax (VAT) was explored. The Government of India (GOI) (1978) initially suggested VAT, but its implementation was deemed difficult due to the large unregistered manufacturing sector. Consequently, the Modified Value Added Tax (MODVAT) was introduced in 1986, initially for select manufacturing sectors, and gradually expanded to cover more goods over the years. This evolved into the Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT) in 2000 (Kumar, 2015, p. 3).
*   **State-level VAT Implementation:** Following the economic reforms of 1991 and pressure from international agencies and big businesses, states moved their sales tax to VAT, with a nationwide implementation across the board in 2005 (Kumar, 2015, p. 3).
*   **Service Tax Introduction:** The central government introduced service tax in 1994, which was progressively expanded to more services. This added another layer to the cascading effect, despite the implementation of CENVAT and state VATs, due to its high buoyancy (Kumar, 2015, p. 4).
*   **Goods and Services Tax (GST):** The latest and most significant reform is the introduction of GST in 2017. It aimed to subsume a multitude of central and state indirect taxes, create a unified national market, and further reduce the cascading effect.

**(b) Overall Revenue Performance of GST in Recent Years (Approx. 5 marks):**
Agarwal et al. (2024) provide a detailed examination of GST's revenue performance since its inception:
*   **Gross Collections vs. Net Revenues:** While monthly gross GST collections have shown an impressive upward trend (from ₹1 lakh crore initially to over ₹2 lakh crore recently), exceeding pre-GST levels as a percentage of GDP, the picture for *net revenues* (gross collections minus refunds to taxpayers) is less optimistic. Net revenues, as a share of GDP, fell steadily until FY21 and as of FY24, were "only barely back to pre-GST levels" (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 2).
*   **Impact of Refunds:** The significant difference between gross and net collections is attributed to substantial refunds, persistently hovering around 0.6%-0.7% of GDP (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 3). The major portion of these refunds is due to Integrated GST (IGST) payments, primarily for exporters who are zero-rated and thus entitled to refunds on input taxes (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 3).
*   **Rate Cuts and Revenue Loss:** A primary reason for the disappointing net revenue performance, despite the initial promise of a revenue bounty, has been the series of rate cuts implemented, especially between 2017 and 2019. The effective GST rate declined significantly, leading to a substantial revenue loss (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 3).
*   **Positive Aspects Amidst Challenges:** Despite these challenges, the authors note some positive aspects. GST has managed to sustain government revenue even with the rate reductions, which benefited consumers. This suggests improvements in collection efficiency and favourable "composition effects," such as a higher share of imports and a shift towards more highly taxed goods (like SUVs), which helped maintain revenue levels, particularly after the pandemic-induced K-shaped recovery (Agarwal et al., 2024, p. 3-4).
