### **22. Illustrate the persistently dismal picture of employment across the organised and unorganised sectors in India. Discuss the key factors behind this dismal picture. How did these factors change the composition of India’s merchandise export? What are the factors impeding the emergence of the large-scale labour-intensive manufacturing in India? (3+3+2+2)**

**(a) Dismal Picture of Employment (3 marks):**
Based on Kujur and Goswami (2021), the Indian manufacturing sector has shown a persistently dismal picture regarding employment creation, contrary to the objectives of the National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) 2011.
*   The NMP aimed to create an additional 100 million jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2022 (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 21).
*   However, instead of creating jobs, the aggregate Indian manufacturing sector experienced a *net job loss* of 14,70,000 between 2010–11 and 2017-18 (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 21).
*   Figure 3 in the article shows that the employment growth rate in aggregate manufacturing was positive (around 1.3%) in 2010-11 but then nosedived to negative territory (-0.66% in 2012-13) and remained negative till 2017-18 (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 22). This indicates a trend of job destruction rather than creation.
*   Even labour-intensive industries specifically identified as potential job absorbers (like textiles, leather, food processing) witnessed significant job destruction (17,31,000 and 6,07,000 respectively for different sub-periods mentioned) (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 22).

**(b) Factors Behind This Dismal Picture (3 marks):**
Kujur and Goswami (2021) attribute this dismal employment picture to the overall failure of the manufacturing sector to achieve its core growth objectives under the NMP, driven by underlying structural issues:
*   **Failure of NMP Growth Targets:** The NMP aimed for a manufacturing GVA growth rate of 10%-12% and increasing manufacturing's share in GDP to 25% by 2022 (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 21). However, the actual growth rate plummeted to negative territory in recent years, and the share in GVA declined after 2017-18 (Figure 1). The dismal performance of the sector itself is the primary reason it failed to generate the targeted employment (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 21, 22).
*   **Waning Technological Depth:** The decline in R&D intensity (Figure 4) and the continuous decline in the acquisition of imported embodied and disembodied technologies (Figure 5) indicate weakening technological capacity (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 22-23). This lack of technological upgrading impedes productivity growth (Figure 6) and overall sector performance, impacting its ability to expand and create jobs.
* **Low Growth of Formal Skilled Workers**: Despite an increase in industrial training institutes (ITIs), the number of formally trained workers have remained awfully low. In fact, the share of workers having vocational training has registered a meagre increase from 0.5% to 0.9% between 2004-05 to 2017-18. Informal training on the other hand is large; its share increasing from 4% to 9.1% between the same time-period. This indicates wasted potential gain from the demographic dividend, which may even turn into a demographic disaster in the future.  
*   **Losing Competitive Advantage:** India has been losing global competitiveness in traditional strong export sectors like pharmaceuticals and automobiles, as evidenced by declining export intensity (Figure 7) (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 23). This loss of competitiveness in key sectors limits expansion and hence job creation potential.
*   **Structural Bottlenecks:** The authors generally refer to "ubiquitous structural bottlenecks" within the NMP framework that have "stymied desired industrial progress" across major dimensions (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 24). These bottlenecks (while not detailed as specific policies/regulations in this section) contribute to the overall underperformance of the sector, leading to job destruction.

**(c) Change in India's Merchandise Export Composition (2 marks):**
The factors discussed above, particularly the loss of competitive advantage and the overall underperformance of the manufacturing sector, have likely influenced the composition of India's merchandise exports.
*   The article specifically highlights the substantial decline in the export intensity of key manufacturing sectors like pharmaceuticals and automobiles after 2013-14 (Figure 7) (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 23).
*   This decline in the export performance of traditionally competitive manufacturing sectors suggests that their share in the overall merchandise export basket may be shrinking or growing slower than other categories.
*   While the article doesn't provide a complete breakdown of the changing composition of *total* merchandise exports, the data presented indicates that manufacturing sectors that were expected to drive export-led growth and employment are losing ground, implying a potential shift in the export composition away from these industries.

**(d) Factors Impeding Emergence of Large-Scale Labour-Intensive Manufacturing (2 marks):**
Kujur and Goswami (2021) do not explicitly list specific factors uniquely impeding *large-scale* labour-intensive manufacturing, but their analysis suggests that the same broad structural bottlenecks affecting overall manufacturing performance are hindering growth and job creation even in these segments:
*   **Overall Sector Underperformance:** The failure of the NMP to boost manufacturing growth and overcome structural bottlenecks has meant that even targeted labour-intensive sectors experienced job destruction instead of creation (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 21, 22).
*   **Lack of Competitiveness/Technological Depth:** While labour-intensive, these sectors still require a degree of technological depth and competitiveness to scale up and compete globally. The waning technological capacity and loss of overall manufacturing competitiveness discussed in the article would also constrain the ability of these sectors to grow into large-scale operations and create mass employment (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 22-23).

The article points out that the promise of large-scale job creation in these labour-intensive sectors under the NMP "is thus far ineffective," directly linking this failure to the dismal performance of the sector as a whole due to "ubiquitous structural bottlenecks" (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 22, 24).

### **28. State the objectives of the National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) 2011. Critically examine the progress of the major objectives of NMP 2011 (3+7)**

**(a) Objectives of the National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) 2011 (3 marks):**
According to Kujur and Goswami (2021), the National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) 2011 was introduced after the global financial crisis of 2008 with the aim of tapping economic opportunities and achieving sustainable growth in the manufacturing sector. Its major objectives were:
*   Increasing the manufacturing sector's contribution to 25% of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2022 (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 20).
*   Creating 100 million additional jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2022 (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 21).
*   Skilling rural migrants and urban poor to make manufacturing growth inclusive (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 22).
*   Improving domestic value addition and technological depth (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 20, 22).
*   Enhancing global competitiveness (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 20, 23).
*   Ensuring the sustainability of growth in terms of energy efficiency and optimal utilisation of natural resources (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 20, 24).

**(b) Critical Examination of the Progress of Major Objectives (7 marks):**
Kujur and Goswami (2021) critically evaluate the progress of the NMP's objectives towards its 2022 deadline, presenting a largely disappointing picture:
*   **Manufacturing Share in GDP and Growth Rate:** The primary goal of increasing the manufacturing share to 25% and achieving a 10%-12% growth rate has not been met. The manufacturing GVA growth rate increased initially but plummeted to negative territory (-1.07% in 2019-20, -3.22% in 2020-21). Similarly, the share of manufacturing in GVA, after a brief surge, declined from 18.36% in 2017-18 to 16.9% in 2020-21 (Figure 1). This indicates a "dismal performance" and the inability of the NMP to achieve its prime growth objectives (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 21). The authors note this decline happened while other emerging Asian economies expanded their manufacturing footprint, suggesting possible "deindustrialisation" in India (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 21).
*   **Job Creation:** The objective of creating 100 million additional jobs has failed. The manufacturing sector experienced a *net job loss* of 14,70,000 between 2010–11 and 2017-18. Employment growth was negative for most of the period from 2012-13 to 2017-18 (Figure 3). Even targeted labour-intensive sectors saw job destruction. The authors conclude this objective has been "ineffective" (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 21, 22).
*   **Skill Development:** While the number of formal vocational training institutes (like ITIs and polytechnics) increased substantially, the corresponding number of vocationally trained workers remained "awfully low." The share of workers with formal vocational training showed only a meagre increase (0.9% in 2017-18 from 0.5% in 2004-05) (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 22). This suggests the skill creation objective has not yielded desired results and the potential demographic dividend is being "wasted" (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 22).
*   **Technological Depth:** The objective of increasing domestic value addition and technological depth has also remained elusive. R&D intensity in manufacturing, though it increased slightly, remained very low compared to other economies and saw a steep drop in 2019-20 (Figure 4). The acquisition of imported technologies also continuously declined (Figure 5) (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 22-23). This indicates a weakening technological capacity, meaning the objective has "not been fructified so far" (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 23).
*   **Global Competitiveness:** The NMP aimed to enhance global competitiveness, leveraging existing strengths. However, sectors with competitive advantages like pharmaceuticals and automobiles saw a substantial decline in their export intensity after 2013-14 (Figure 7) (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 23). This indicates the NMP has been "unsuccessful in sustaining and promoting the global competitiveness" and failed to harness existing strengths (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 23).
*   **Resource Efficiency:** The objective of ensuring environmental sustainability through energy and material efficiency showed stagnation. Energy intensity declined initially but remained stagnant since 2003-04. Similarly, material intensity remained constant around 55%-60% since 2003-04 (Figure 8) (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 24). This indicates the NMP has not contributed much to improving energy and material efficiency (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 24).

Overall, the examination reveals that most, if not all, major objectives of the NMP 2011 were far from being achieved by the stipulated deadline, indicating ubiquitous structural bottlenecks and warranting a relook and reorientation of future policies (Kujur and Goswami, 2021, p. 24).
