### **16. State the objectives of flexible inflation targeting (FIT) strategy in India. Mention the unconventional monetary policy measures taken by the RBI during the period of pandemic. Discuss the inflation experience before and during the FIT regime in India. What have been the major achievements of the FIT regime in India? (2+2+3+3)**  

**(a) Objectives of the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) Strategy in India (2 Marks):**
The Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) regime was officially adopted in India in May 2016 after the amendment of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The primary objectives of FIT are:
1. Anchoring inflation expectations — by maintaining inflation within a specified target range, FIT aims to provide price stability and support economic growth.
2. Enhancing monetary policy credibility — by establishing inflation as the nominal anchor, the policy framework strengthens RBI’s independence and effectiveness in controlling inflation.

**(b) Unconventional Monetary Policy Measures Taken by RBI during the Pandemic (2 Marks):**
During the COVID-19 pandemic, RBI implemented both conventional and unconventional monetary policy measures to mitigate economic disruptions and stabilize financial markets. Unconventional measures included:
1. Liquidity Injection Programs —RBI introduced Targeted Long-Term Repo Operations (TLTROs) and Special Liquidity Facilities for banks, NBFCs, and financial institutions to maintain credit flow.
2. Government Security Acquisition Programs (G-SAPs) — This allowed RBI to purchase government bonds, ensuring market liquidity without excessive monetary expansion.
3. Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) — Introduced in April 2022, SDF enabled RBI to absorb excess liquidity without collateral.
4. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) cut —CRR was reduced by 1370 billion INR, freeing up bank reserves to support lending.

**(c) Inflation Experience Before and During the FIT Regime (3 Marks):**
- Before FIT (Pre-2015): Inflation in India was highly volatile, particularly between 2009 and 2014, due to high food and fuel prices. The monetary policy lacked clear anchoring, leading to inconsistent inflation control.
- During FIT (2016 Onwards): 
  1. Reduced Inflation Volatility —Inflation remained within the prescribed range of 4% ±2%, except during the pandemic years.
  2. Pandemic Disruptions —Inflation spiked beyond the RBI’s comfort zone, with food and fuel prices causing concern, especially in 2020–21 and 2022.
  3. Global Supply Shocks — Despite external pressures, the FIT framework helped stabilize inflation expectations, reinforcing monetary policy credibility.

**(d) Major Achievements of the FIT Regime in India (3 Marks):**
1. Inflation Control—Inflation rates post-2016 were comparatively lower than pre-2015 levels, reflecting effective monetary management.
2. Strengthened Financial Stability —Banks’ non-performing assets (NPAs) improved significantly, supported by bank recapitalization and better regulatory oversight.
3. Monetary Policy Transmission — The adoption of clear inflation goals enhanced RBI’s ability to manage interest rates and liquidity, improving financial market stability.

While the FIT regime has had successes, supply-side shocks, particularly food and energy prices, remain challenges. The debate on whether headline inflation or core inflation should be targeted continues, especially given India’s high exposure to food price fluctuations.

### **17. Discuss the major factors behind the recent improvement in asset quality of commercial banks in India. What are the recent past development in digital payment infrastructure in India? Discuss the outcomes of these initiatives. (4+2+4)**  

**(a) Major Factors Behind the Recent Improvement in Asset Quality of Commercial Banks in India (4 Marks):**
The asset quality of commercial banks in India has seen a significant improvement in recent years, driven by several key factors:

1. Implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016
   - The establishment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) simplified and accelerated corporate bankruptcy processes.
   - The IBC framework improved credit recovery, allowing banks to resolve stressed assets more effectively.
2. Regulatory and Supervisory Enhancements by RBI  
   - RBI strengthened off-site surveillance systems using SupTech (automated data analysis tools).
   - Big data techniques and cyber-security initiatives have enhanced risk monitoring and regulatory oversight
3. Bank Consolidation and Merger Strategies 
   - The government merged 10 public sector banks into four entities, improving operational efficiency and asset management.
   - Mergers helped streamline lending practices and recover non-performing assets.
4. Government-Driven Recapitalization Efforts 
   - The government infused ₹3.1 trillion into public sector banks between 2016–2021, with a large portion allocated through recapitalization bonds.
   - This infusion strengthened bank balance sheets and improved credit flows to the economy.

**(b) Recent Developments in Digital Payment Infrastructure in India (2 Marks):**
India has witnessed remarkable progress in its digital payment infrastructure, led by both public and private sector initiatives:

1. UPI Expansion and Interoperability  
   - The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has seen significant growth, enabling seamless peer-to-peer and merchant transactions.
   - Introduction of UPI Lite and UPI for feature phones broadened digital access.

2. Government-Driven Digital Payment Frameworks 
   - The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has expanded its role in overseeing digital financial transactions.
   - Programs like E-Rupi, a digital voucher payment system, were introduced to facilitate targeted transactions.

**(c) Outcomes of These Initiatives (4 Marks):**
The developments in banking asset quality and digital payments have led to several transformative outcomes:

1. Improved Financial Stability  
   - Banks reported the lowest gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio in a decade (3.2% in September 2023), strengthening financial stability.
   - Enhanced credit monitoring reduced loan defaults and improved borrower behaviour.
2. Widespread Adoption of Digital Payments  
   - Digital transaction volume and value increased substantially, integrating digital payments into daily commerce.
   - Small businesses and rural consumers gained access to digital financial services, enhancing economic inclusivity.
3. Boost to Economic Growth and Policy Transmission 
   - With banks regaining lending confidence, credit availability for businesses improved.
   - Digital payments contributed to GDP growth by increasing financial efficiency and reducing cash dependency.
4. Enhanced Consumer Convenience and Cyber-security Measures 
   - The convenience of QR code payments and UPI-based transactions simplified digital commerce.
   - Strengthened cyber-security protocols reduced fraud risks, ensuring safer digital transactions.
