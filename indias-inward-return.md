### **1. Examine whether India has been turning inward in the context of macroeconomic policies. Evaluate the twin policy prescriptions in recent years: domestic demand over export; and protectionism over freer trade. (3+7 Marks)**

**(a) Inward Turn in Macroeconomic Policies (3 marks):**
Chatterjee and Subramanian (2020) argue that an inward orientation has indeed become central to India's recent policy and intellectual discourse on the macroeconomic front. This shift is primarily driven by the perception that India's growth slowdown prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was caused by weakening domestic demand, particularly consumption. Consequently, there has been a concerted search for policies aimed explicitly at reviving domestic demand. Proposals discussed include income redistribution, agricultural reforms to boost rural incomes, and increased public investment (Chatterjee and Subramanian, 2020, p. 4). The authors note that this focus is not merely a short-term response but is being advocated as the new medium-term growth strategy for India. This thinking parallels, perhaps mimics, debates in advanced economies regarding secular stagnation and the need for forceful demand-side measures. It also draws inspiration from academic models suggesting large countries can leverage their domestic market size to boost demand and incentivize growth (Chatterjee and Subramanian, 2020, p. 4).

**(b) Evaluation of Twin Policy Prescriptions (7 marks):**
Chatterjee and Subramanian (2020) critically evaluate the twin prescriptions favouring domestic demand over exports and protectionism over free trade:
1. **Domestic Demand over Exports:** The authors argue that relying on domestic demand to propel rapid growth in the medium term is highly problematic and unlikely to succeed. Their reasoning is based on the stressed state of nearly all balance sheets in the economy (Chatterjee and Subramanian, 2020, p. 19).
    * *Investment* is constrained by firms' weak financial positions post-lockdown and a struggling banking system burdened by NPAs, further hampered by a poor climate for risk-taking.
    * *Consumption* is limited by high household debt and its dependence on income growth, which itself is weak.
    * *Government spending* is severely circumscribed by already high deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios (projected 85-90 percent), exacerbated by the pandemic, with little fiscal space remaining, especially given the risk of ratings downgrades if debt rises further (Chatterjee and Subramanian, 2020, p. 20).
    The paper contends that given these constraints, domestic demand cannot be the primary engine. Instead, following the example of East Asian economies post-Asian Financial Crisis, India should focus on exporting its way out of the crisis. Abandoning export orientation in favour of constrained domestic demand is described as "killing the goose that lays golden eggs" and, given the circumstances, "killing the only goose that can lay eggs" (Chatterjee and Subramanian, 2020, p. 19). Furthermore, they note the lack of historical precedent for any developing country achieving sustained high growth (over 6 percent) based primarily on domestic demand (p. 19).

2. **Protectionism over Free Trade:** The authors argue that protectionism will not work as an effective export strategy and is counterproductive for growth.
    * *Historical evidence* in India shows weak export performance under the protectionist license-quota-raj, while exports boomed after liberalization (Chatterjee and Subramanian, 2020, p. 20).
    * *Exports require imports:* India's exports are shown to be highly correlated with imports (correlation coefficient 0.75), indicating that openness is necessary to sustain exports (Figure 9, p. 21).
    * *Low-skill export opportunity requires openness:* India's major unexploited export opportunity lies in low-skill manufacturing (apparel, clothing, leather, footwear). Success in these sectors requires deep integration into global value chains and significant imports of parts and components, mirroring the strategies of China and Vietnam (Table 5, p. 22-23). Protectionism, by raising input costs, would hinder competitiveness in these crucial sectors.
    * *Protectionism breeds inefficiency:* While acknowledging some import substitution in cellphones due to protectionist measures, the authors question the scalability and long-term efficiency of this approach, especially once incentives end, noting the cellphone market's uniquely large domestic size isn't representative of other sectors (p. 22). Protectionism fundamentally raises costs and shields firms from the competitive pressures needed to become efficient exporters.
Therefore, the paper concludes that both prescriptions are flawed: relying on domestic demand ignores severe balance sheet constraints, while protectionism undermines the competitiveness needed to seize India's significant export opportunities.

### **2. State the assumptions behind the self-reliance or Atmanirbhar-Bharat, strategy for future growth of Indian economy. What are the myths underlying in Indian's inward polices? Dispel the myths in light of the arguments of Chatterjee and Subramanian (2019). (3+2+5)**

**(a) Assumptions Behind Self-Reliance Strategy (3 marks):**
Chatterjee and Subramanian (2020) argue that the inward turn, exemplified by the call for *atmanirbharta* or self-reliance, is based on a specific diagnosis of the economic situation and future prospects. The underlying assumptions, as identified and subsequently challenged by the authors, are:
1. India possesses a large and buoyant domestic market capable of serving as the primary engine for long-run growth (Chatterjee and Subramanian, 2020, p. 3, 8).
2. India's past growth trajectory has primarily been driven by domestic demand, with exports (especially manufacturing exports) playing a non-critical role (Chatterjee and Subramanian, 2020, p. 3, 10).
3. Future export prospects are inherently dim due to a perceived trend of deglobalization and shrinking global opportunities, making an inward focus necessary (Chatterjee and Subramanian, 2020, p. 3, 14).

**(b) Myths Underlying India's Inward Policies (2 marks):**
Chatterjee and Subramanian (2020, p. 7) explicitly state that the inward turn is based on three core myths:
1.  **Myth 1:** Growth can be based on the domestic market because it is big.
2.  **Myth 2:** India's growth has not been driven by exports and certainly not manufacturing exports.
3.  **Myth 3:** Export-led growth is not possible in the post-Covid world (implying export prospects are dim).

**(c) Dispelling the Myths (5 marks):**
Chatterjee and Subramanian (2020) systematically dispel these three myths with evidence and arguments:
* **Dispelling Myth 1 (Domestic market is big):** The authors argue that India's "true" consumer market is much smaller than commonly perceived (p. 8-10). Using estimates of the population with meaningful purchasing power (>$5.5 or >$15 PPP per day), they find India's market size is only a fraction (15-45%) of its headline GDP, roughly 15-20% of China's comparable market size, and a tiny 1.5-5% of the global market (world trade). This is attributed to a large poor population and high savings rates among the affluent. They contrast this with China's outward turn in the early 2000s when its GDP was similar to India's today, arguing China correctly assessed its domestic market as too small then (p. 10).
* **Dispelling Myth 2 (Exports not critical for growth):** The paper presents data showing India has been an "exemplar of export-led growth" since the 1990s (p. 10). Overall export growth (goods and services) averaged 13.4% annually (1995-2018), the third-best performance globally, nearly twice the world average (Figure 3a). Manufacturing exports grew at 12.1% annually over the same period, also third-best globally (Figure 3b). Exports consistently accounted for about one-third of "exogenous" aggregate demand growth over three decades (Table 2, p. 11-12). This stellar export performance played a critical role in driving/sustaining India's overall high GDP growth.
* **Dispelling Myth 3 (Export prospects are dim):** The authors contest the pessimism about future exports (p. 14-18).
    * *Deglobalization is overstated:* World trade in services continues to grow, and the pandemic may accelerate digitally-delivered services where India has an advantage (p. 14).
    * *India can gain market share:* India's global export share is small (1.7% in manufacturing, less than Vietnam), meaning it can achieve high export growth by increasing its share even if global trade grows slowly. A pessimistic scenario simulation shows India doubling its market share would still be modest globally (Table 3, p. 15-16).
    * *Major untapped opportunity:* India vastly underperforms in low-skill manufacturing exports relative to its large share of the global unskilled labor force (Figure 8). This represents a $60 billion annual export gap, or $140 billion production gap in textiles/clothing alone (p. 16-17).
    * *China's exit:* China is vacating ~$140 billion in low-skill export space (apparel, footwear, etc.) due to rising wages, creating a concrete opportunity for India (Table 4, p. 17-18).
    * *Supply chain diversification:* Post-Covid trends to diversify supply chains away from China present another opportunity for India (p. 15).
Thus, the paper argues that all three premises underlying the inward turn are flawed; the domestic market is small, exports have been crucial for past growth, and significant export opportunities remain.

### **3. Do you think export led growth is possible in the post-covid Indian economy? Justify your answer. Evaluate the proposition domestic demand over export and protectionism over free trade to ensure the high growth rate in India in coming years. (5+5)**

**(a) Possibility of Export-Led Growth Post-Covid (5 marks):**
Yes, Chatterjee and Subramanian (2020) argue strongly that export-led growth *is* possible for India in the post-Covid economy.
**Justification:**
1. **Services Globalization Continues:** The authors argue that the "demise of globalization" is exaggerated. While goods trade stagnated post-GFC, services trade continued to grow as a share of global GDP (Figure 7, p. 15). Post-Covid trends favouring activities done at a distance (remote work, e-commerce) could further accelerate the globalization of services, an area where India has a clear comparative advantage (p. 14).
2. **Potential for Market Share Gains:** India's share in global exports, especially manufacturing (1.7%), is small. This implies that even if overall world trade growth remains sluggish, India can achieve high export growth rates simply by capturing a larger share of the existing market (p. 15). The paper demonstrates through a scenario that even rapid Indian export growth (8% vs 2% world growth) would lead to only a modest increase in India's global market share over a decade, suggesting the global system can accommodate it (Table 3, p. 16).
3. **Huge Unexploited Low-Skill Export Potential:** India significantly under-exports relative to its large endowment of unskilled labor, particularly in manufacturing sectors like apparel, textiles, leather, and footwear (Figure 8, p. 17). This represents a massive untapped potential for future export growth.
4. **China Vacating Export Space:** China's rising wages and shifting economic structure mean it is actively ceding market share in low-skill, labor-intensive exports (~$140 billion post-GFC). This creates a large, readily available market opportunity for countries like India to step into (Table 4, p. 17-18).
5. **Supply Chain Diversification:** The pandemic highlighted risks of relying on a single country for supply chains. Concerted efforts by global firms to diversify sourcing create a potential opening for India as a major low-cost alternative supplier (p. 15).

Therefore, despite potential global headwinds, the combination of ongoing services globalization, India's small current market share, its specific unexploited potential in low-skill sectors being vacated by China, and post-Covid diversification trends provides a strong basis for believing export-led growth remains a viable and significant opportunity for India.

**(b) Evaluation of Domestic Demand & Protectionism for High Growth (5 marks):**
Chatterjee and Subramanian (2020) evaluate the propositions of prioritizing domestic demand and using protectionism as strategies to ensure *high* growth rates in India, concluding both are detrimental.
1. **Domestic Demand over Export:** This strategy is deemed incapable of delivering the *high* (e.g., 8%+) sustained growth India needs.
    * *Severe Constraints:* As detailed previously, stressed balance sheets (public sector debt, corporate NPAs, household debt) severely limit the potential for domestic demand (investment, consumption, government spending) to act as a powerful growth engine in the medium term (p. 19-20). Relying on further stressing these balance sheets is not feasible.
    * *Lack of Precedent:* The authors assert there is no historical example of a developing country achieving sustained high growth primarily through domestic demand; successful high-growth trajectories (e.g., East Asia) have been export-oriented (p. 19).
    * *Opportunity Cost:* Prioritizing constrained domestic demand means foregoing the significant growth potential offered by exports, akin to "killing the only goose that can lay eggs" (p. 19).
2. **Protectionism over Free Trade:** This strategy is argued to be counterproductive for achieving high growth, particularly via exports.
    * *Undermines Export Competitiveness:* Protectionism raises costs (especially for imported inputs) and incentivizes inefficiency, making it harder for domestic firms to compete in global markets (p. 22). This is particularly damaging for the key low-skill manufacturing sectors (apparel, leather etc.) which are import-intensive and require integration into global value chains for success (p. 22-23). Achieving the necessary scale and efficiency for high export growth in these areas demands *more* openness, not less.
    * *Historical Failure:* India's own history demonstrates that the protectionist era yielded low growth and weak exports, whereas the post-liberalization era saw an export boom and higher GDP growth (p. 20-21).
    * *Limited Success of Targeted Protection:* While acknowledging potential import substitution in cellphones, the paper questions the generalizability and long-term efficiency gains from such protectionist measures, arguing they cannot form the basis of a broad high-growth strategy (p. 22).
In conclusion, the paper argues that neither prioritizing domestic demand nor embracing protectionism offers a path to high growth for India. Given the constraints on domestic balance sheets and the nature of global opportunities (especially in low-skill manufacturing), only a strategy focused on **boosting exports through greater openness and integration** can realistically deliver the high growth rates India aspires to.
