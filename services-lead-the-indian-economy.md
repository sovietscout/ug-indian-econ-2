**(a) Structure of the Service Sector and Reasons for its Prominence in India (3 Marks):**

**Structure of the Service Sector in India:**
The service sector is the dominant contributor to the Indian economy.
1.  **Overall Contribution:** In 2018-19, services accounted for 54.3% of India's Gross Value Added (GVA), significantly larger than agriculture (14.4%) and industry (31.3%). In terms of employment, it provided 29.8% of jobs in 2015 (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 17, Table 2.1).
2.  **Composition:** The sector is varied, ranging from highly human capital-intensive services like IT-oriented business services to less human capital-intensive but labour-intensive ones like hotel and restaurant services (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 17).
    *   Krishna et al. (2017, as cited in Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 17) classify services into:
        *   **Market Services:** These include IT-intensive services (27% of total GVA, nearly half of GVA from services) and non-IT-intensive services (7.8% of total GVA). Key market services include trade, financial services, post & telecom, renting of machinery & business services, hotels & restaurants, and transport & storage (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 18, Table 2.2).
        *   **Non-Market Services:** Mostly government-funded, accounting for 20% of aggregate GVA, with education contributing 4%. Public administration & defense are also significant (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 18, Table 2.2).
3.  **Human Capital Intensity:** Human capital-intensive services, including ICT and education, contribute significantly (around 31% of services' GVA). The IT industry is a major export earner and employer (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 17-18).

**Reasons for Prominence of the Service Sector:**
The prominence of services in India is attributed to a combination of factors:
1.  **Historical and Sociological Factors:** India's history and societal structure, particularly the caste system, favored certain groups (Brahmins, ruling class, merchant class) with an inherited association with literate services, education, trade, and administration. This created a predisposition towards service professions (Roy, 2011, as cited in Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 19). The software industry, for instance, reflects this caste-oriented educational background (Upadhya, 2004, as cited in Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 19).
2.  **Business Culture and Managerial Expertise:** India has a long history of business entrepreneurship and managerial expertise in trade and finance, with communities like Banias, Marwaris, and Parsis playing significant roles. This fostered "market managers" adept at service-oriented firms rather than manufacturing (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 19-20).
3.  **Nehruvian Industrial Strategy:** The post-independence industrialisation strategy (Nehru-Mahalanobis model) focused on heavy industries and self-sufficiency, leading to the establishment of higher education institutions (IITs, IIMs). These institutions produced skilled human capital, sometimes surplus to domestic manufacturing needs, which later fueled the growth of the software and service sectors, partly through the returning diaspora (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 20-21).
4.  **Factor Endowments:** The article argues that India's factor endowments lean towards human capital and services-oriented managerial expertise, rather than just an abundance of unskilled labor (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 21).
5.  **External Factors and Policy Environment:** Eichengreen and Gupta (2009, as cited in Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 16) note that a second wave of growth in demand for services is often seen in democracies open to trade and near financial centers, features relevant to India's service sector growth, especially since the 1990s.
6.  **Limitations in Manufacturing:** Challenges in establishing a large, labour-intensive manufacturing sector, due to issues like labour laws and regulations, also indirectly contributed to the relative prominence of services (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 21).

**(b) Characteristics of a Leading Sector and Examination of India's Service Sector (2 Marks):**

**Characteristics of a Leading Sector:**
According to the Ministry of Finance (Government of India, 2015, as cited in Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 22), a leading sector, or an engine of growth, should exhibit the following five criteria:
1.  High level of productivity.
2.  Domestic and international convergence of productivity.
3.  Expansion.
4.  Alignment with comparative advantage.
5.  Tradability.

**(c) Can the Service Sector be the Leading Sector in India? (5 marks)**
Examining India's service sector against these characteristics:
1.  **Productivity and Convergence:** Certain components of the services sector, particularly IT-related business services, demonstrate high productivity and are converging both domestically and internationally (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 22-23).
2.  **Expansion:** The service sector has shown significant expansion, contributing substantially to national income growth, often more than agriculture and manufacturing (Krishna et al., 2016, as cited in Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 23).
3.  **Tradability:** Many services, especially IT and business services, are highly tradable, as evidenced by India's significant software exports (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 23).
4.  **Alignment with Comparative Advantage:** The article argues that while a broad interpretation might suggest India's comparative advantage lies in unskilled labor, a more nuanced view indicates that India's actual comparative advantage, considering its human capital endowments and managerial skills, is in human capital-intensive services. India's exports, including technology and human capital-intensive manufactures alongside software, support this view (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 23).

**Examination:**
The service sector in India meets several criteria of a leading sector. However, the article emphasizes that the key question is not services *versus* manufacturing, but how services can complement and lead the overall economy (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 24).
*   **Role as Inputs and Catalysts:** Most services, especially business services like IT, finance, and insurance, are inputs into the production of final goods and other services. Their ability to lead stems from their capacity to "act as catalysts in the production process of goods and other services as well. It is in this broad sense that they can be a leading sector in the economy; they facilitate the growth of the other sectors" (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 22).
*   **Facilitating Other Sectors:** The service sector can lead by:
    *   Increasing the productivity of agriculture and industry by promoting modern know-how.
    *   Supporting the outsourcing of manufacturing components to the unorganized sector.
    *   Promoting non-farm production activities in rural areas, including the migration of manufacturing firms, with IT, finance, and transport services playing a crucial role in marketing and logistics (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 24).
*   **Leveraging Complementarity:** The focus should be on "utilising the complementarity between the two sectors [services and manufacturing], exploiting the potential of services in promoting labour skills required in manufacturing and agriculture and in assisting the regional spread of industry" (Balasubramanyam and Balasubramanyam, p. 24).

In conclusion, the service sector can indeed be a leading sector in India, not necessarily by solely driving growth independently, but more powerfully by leveraging India's human capital endowments to act as a crucial input and catalyst for development across the entire economy, including agriculture and manufacturing. Its role in enhancing productivity, facilitating market access, and promoting skill development is central to its leadership potential.
