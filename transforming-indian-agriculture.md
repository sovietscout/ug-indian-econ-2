### **29. Illustrate the emerging issues in Indian agricultural sector? Discuss the remedial measures for sustainable agricultural intensification. (5+5)**

**(a) Emerging Issues in Indian Agricultural Sector (5 marks):**
Based on Gulati and Juneja (2022), despite India's transformation from a food-deficit to a food-surplus nation, the agricultural sector faces several significant emerging issues:
*   **Pressure on Natural Resources:** The process of agricultural intensification, while ensuring food security, has caused undesirable consequences on natural resources and the environment. This includes degradation of soil, depletion of groundwater, salinisation in irrigated areas, and pollution of soil, air, and water from chemical inputs (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 26).
    *   **Illustration:** The study highlights the alarming state of groundwater depletion, with a 2017 assessment showing that 1034 blocks across India are 'over-exploited', 253 are 'critical', and 681 are 'semi-critical' (Figure 13). In Punjab, a key agricultural state, 78% of the geographical area shows a decline in water levels over time (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 26, 28). Land degradation affects an estimated 37% of the land area in the country (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 28).
*   **Environmental Impact (GHG Emissions):** Agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in India (18% of total emissions), primarily from livestock rearing, excessive use of chemical fertilisers, paddy cultivation, and residue burning (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 28).
*   **Policy-Induced Distortions:** Longstanding policies like input subsidies (power, fertilisers) and price support (MSP for paddy and wheat) have led to production choices skewed towards water-intensive crops, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 26).
*   **Nutritional Security Challenges:** Despite achieving food sufficiency, India still faces significant challenges in nutritional security. A substantial portion of the population remains undernourished, and there are high rates of stunting, wasting, and anaemia among children and women (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 31, 32). This indicates a need to improve access to and affordability of nutritious foods beyond just staple grains.
*   **Viability of Smallholders:** Increasing fragmentation and shrinking size of land holdings make cultivation less profitable for marginal and small farmers, posing a major challenge for their viability and adoption of new technologies (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 12).
*   **Low Labour Productivity:** The declining share of agriculture in GDP (16.5% in 2019) compared to its persistently large share in the workforce (42.3% in 2019) results in low labour productivity, severely impacting value addition in the sector (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 11, 16).

**(b) Remedial Measures for Sustainable Agricultural Intensification (5 marks):**
To address these emerging issues and ensure sustainable agricultural intensification, Gulati and Juneja (2022) propose several remedial measures, focusing on innovations, incentives, and institutions:
*   **Promoting Resource-Efficient Practices:**
    *   **Water:** Reduce area under water-intensive rice cultivation in stressed regions like Punjab and Haryana, shifting it to eastern India. Adopt water-saving irrigation techniques such as 'alternate wetting drying (AWD)' and 'direct seeded rice (DSR)' in paddy cultivation, and promote micro-irrigation technologies (drip and sprinkler) more widely (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 29). Implement decentralized rainwater harvesting and regulate groundwater extraction through institutional mechanisms (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 29, 30, 34).
    *   **Fertilisers:** Encourage judicious use of chemical fertilisers based on soil health (Soil Health Card scheme). Promote a shift towards nutrient-based subsidies for all fertilisers (including urea) and eventually move to direct cash transfer of subsidies to farmers (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 30).
    *   **Residue Management:** Provide incentives for farmers to adopt efficient ways to deal with crop residue, such as using it for biogas production, particularly in areas prone to stubble burning (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 30).
*   **Technological Innovations:**
    *   Invest in and promote the adoption of climate-resilient seeds with tolerance to drought and floods (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 31, 32).
    *   Support bio-fortification of staple crops (like wheat and rice) to address micronutrient deficiencies and improve nutritional security (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 32, 33).
    *   Explore and scale up innovations in farming practices such as protected agriculture (hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaponics, poly-house farming) (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 33).
    *   Leverage technologies like geo-tagging, digitalisation of agri-value chains, big data, IoT, and AI, and strengthen the extension system to scale these up (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 35, 34).
*   **Policy and Institutional Reforms:**
    *   Reform land laws to free up lease markets and potentially revoke land ceilings to encourage consolidation and create economically viable holdings, facilitating long-term investments and productivity gains (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 34).
    *   Shift policy priority from input subsidies (which are less distorting) to direct income support measures for farmers (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 33).
    *   Create institutions to regulate unsustainable water extraction and govern rights over water, land tenure, and user relationships (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 34).
    *   Promote custom hire centres and 'Uberisation' platforms to provide affordable access to farm machinery services for smallholders (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 34).
    *   Strengthen the agricultural extension system to provide timely, reliable information and advice to farmers (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 34).

These measures collectively aim to make agriculture more productive, profitable, sustainable, and resilient while addressing environmental concerns and ensuring nutritional security (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 31, 34).

### **30. Mention the significant transformation of productions in Indian Agriculture and the role of innovation and institutions in each case. Discuss the potential innovations, incentives and institutional development for ensuring food security in near future India. (5+5)**

**(a) Significant Production Transformations, Innovation, and Institutions (5 marks):**
Gulati and Juneja (2022) highlight several significant production transformations in Indian agriculture since the 1960s, emphasizing the role played by innovations and institutions:
*   **Staple Crops (Green Revolution):** India transformed from a food-deficit country in the 1960s, heavily reliant on food aid (PL-480), to self-sufficient in staple grains (wheat and rice) and eventually a major exporter (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 21, 22).
    *   **Innovation:** This was triggered by the introduction and commercialisation of high-yielding miracle seeds of wheat (from Mexico) and rice (from the Philippines) (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 21). Extensive irrigation and increased fertiliser use were also key technological inputs.
    *   **Institutions:** Institutional support was crucial, including the establishment of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for procurement and storage, the Agricultural Prices Commission (APC/CACP) for price support (MSP), and massive government investment in irrigation infrastructure (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 21).
*   **Milk Production (White Revolution/Operation Flood):** India transformed into the world's largest milk producer, moving from a backyard activity to an organised, commercial sector (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 22).
    *   **Innovation:** While not solely technology-driven like the Green Revolution seeds, innovations included improved herd numbers and management practices.
    *   **Institutions:** This revolution was essentially driven by "institutional engineering" through 'Operation Flood', spearheaded by Verghese Kurien. It established a co-operative structure for milk collection from smallholders and an organised retail network for processing and distribution (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 22). De-licensing of the dairy sector in 2002 encouraged private sector participation.
*   **Poultry Sector (Poultry Revolution):** The sector transformed from a backyard activity into a major organised, commercial enterprise, making India a leading producer of eggs and poultry meat (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 22, 23).
    *   **Innovation:** Key innovations included liberalisation of imports of grandparent poultry stock, vertical integration of operations, and contract farming models (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 22).
    *   **Institutions:** Policy innovations facilitating imports and private sector-driven contract farming were instrumental (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 22).
*   **Horticulture Crops (Golden Revolution):** Over the last decade, horticulture production (fruits, vegetables, spices, floriculture) has significantly increased, even surpassing food grains output in value (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 14, 23). India is now the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables globally.
    *   **Innovation:** While not explicitly detailed as a single innovation, this growth is linked to improved varieties and farming practices suited for horticulture.
    *   **Institutions:** The National Horticulture Mission (2004-05) played a major role in driving this growth (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 23).
*   **Cotton (Gene Revolution):** The introduction of Bt cotton led to a remarkable increase in cotton production, making India the largest producer globally (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 23, 24).
    *   **Innovation:** The key innovation was the widespread commercialisation of Bt cotton (the only GM crop in India), along with significant R&D investments by private seed companies (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 23).
    *   **Institutions:** Policy decisions allowing the introduction and commercialisation of Bt cotton were foundational (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 23).

**(b) Potential Innovations, Incentives, and Institutional Development for Future Food Security (5 marks):**
For ensuring food security (including feed and fibre) for a growing population and potentially generating surpluses for export by 2030 and beyond, Gulati and Juneja (2022) emphasize the crucial role of the "3 'I's": Innovations, Incentives, and Institutions (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 31).
*   **Innovations:**
    *   Focus on developing and promoting **climate-resilient seeds** tolerant to drought and floods to mitigate risks associated with climate change (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 31, 32).
    *   Promote **bio-fortification** of staple crops to address hidden hunger and nutritional security alongside calorie sufficiency (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 32).
    *   Scale up modern farming practices like **protected agriculture** (hydroponics, aeroponics, etc.) for higher productivity from limited land (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 33).
    *   Leverage **digital technologies** (IoT, AI, big data) for efficient resource management and decision-making in agriculture (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 35).
*   **Incentives:**
    *   Shift policy focus from input subsidies (which can cause distortions) to **direct income support** or cash transfers to farmers, providing more predictable and less distorting support that incentivizes investment and better resource use (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 33).
    *   Provide **incentives for resource conservation**, specifically for saving water and energy, through mechanisms like the 'paani bachao, paise kamao' scheme in Punjab, rewarding efficient input use (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 33).
    *   Design incentives to promote **judicious fertiliser use** based on soil health and shift towards market-based pricing for fertilisers with direct subsidy transfers (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 30).
*   **Institutions:**
    *   Undertake urgent reforms in **land laws** to free up lease markets and remove restrictions, enabling land consolidation and formation of economically viable holdings for increased productivity and investment (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 34).
    *   Establish strong **institutions for regulating water extraction**, including regulating tube wells, identifying aquifers, and managing the overall rate of exploitation, supported by clear rights and financial incentives (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 34).
    *   Promote **institutional models** like custom hire centres and 'Uberisation' platforms to provide smallholders with affordable access to farm machinery and technology (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 34).
    *   Strengthen and reorient the **agricultural extension system** to effectively disseminate knowledge, technology, and market information to farmers, especially smallholders facing diverse challenges (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 34, 35).

These interconnected innovations, incentives, and institutional reforms are critical pathways identified by the authors to ensure India can meet future demand for food, feed, and fibre sustainably and profitably.

### **31. Discuss the significant changes of input uses in Indian agriculture during post green revolution era. State the government initiatives and their performances for doubling farmers’ income. (5+5)**

**(a) Significant Changes in Input Uses Post-Green Revolution (5 marks):**
Gulati and Juneja (2022) discuss the significant changes in the use of key inputs in Indian agriculture, particularly intensified post-Green Revolution:
*   **Land Use and Intensity:** While the net sown area remained relatively stagnant around 140 mha, the gross cropped area increased (from 172.6 mha in 1981-82 to 200.2 mha in 2016-17). This was achieved through increased **cropping intensity**, rising from 123.1% in 1980-81 to 143.6% in 2016-17 (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 15). Higher intensity implies more intensive use of the same land, often facilitated by irrigation. However, fragmentation of landholdings increased, with the average size declining significantly (from 2.28 ha in 1970-71 to 1.08 ha in 2015-16), impacting the viability of small farms and technology adoption (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 12).
*   **Water (Irrigation):** Access to irrigation water became a crucial factor enabling higher cropping intensity and productivity. India's irrigation cover reached 48.7% of cultivated area (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 11). The increasing reliance on intensive irrigation, particularly flood irrigation in states like Punjab and Haryana for water-intensive crops (rice), has led to significant **groundwater depletion**, an "alarming state" in some regions (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 26, 28).
*   **Fertilisers:** The use of chemical fertilisers (NPK) increased dramatically post-Green Revolution, rising from 2.17 kg/ha in 1961-62 to 134 kg/ha in 2018-19 (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 16). However, this intensification has resulted in an **imbalanced use** of fertilisers, particularly overuse of nitrogenous fertilisers (urea), causing widespread deficiency of secondary and micronutrients in the soil and contributing to pollution and GHG emissions (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 28, 30).
*   **Labour:** Agriculture's share in the total workforce declined (from 66.5% in 1981 to 42.3% in 2019), indicating a shift away from agriculture, though the absolute number of workers in agriculture increased. The composition of the agricultural workforce also changed, with the share of agricultural labourers surpassing that of cultivators by 2011 (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 16, 17). This suggests a relative decrease in the importance of human labour per unit of output compared to other inputs.
*   **Capital and Mechanisation:** Indian agriculture shifted from a subsistence-based, labour-intensive system to a more capital and knowledge-intensive one. Farm mechanisation increased significantly, substituting human and animal power with machine power. By 2013-14, mechanical and electrical sources accounted for about 88% of total farm power (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 11, 20). Gross Capital Formation in agriculture as a percentage of GDP increased, peaking around 2011-12, although its sufficiency for sustainable growth is questioned (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 18). The share of public investment in agriculture declined significantly over the years, with growth largely driven by private investment (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 19).

**(b) Government Initiatives and Performance for Doubling Farmers’ Income (5 marks):**
Gulati and Juneja (2022) discuss some government initiatives aimed at improving farmers' income and market access, although they don't explicitly detail a comprehensive "doubling farmers' income" strategy and its overall performance:
*   **Agri-Marketing Reforms (Farm Laws 2020):** The government legislated three laws in 2020 aimed at liberalizing agri-markets, facilitating private investments in supply chains, and providing options for farmers to sell produce outside the traditional APMC *mandis* (FPTC Act, FAPAFS Act, amended ECA). The intention was to make agri-marketing more efficient and ensure remunerative prices for farmers, thereby boosting income (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 19).
    *   **Performance:** These laws faced widespread protests, particularly from farmers fearing the dismantling of the MSP and *mandi* system. Consequently, the government repealed these laws in November 2021. This rollback highlights the challenges in implementing market-oriented reforms perceived as threatening existing support structures, rendering their potential impact on farmers' income unrealized in this form (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 19).
*   **Incentives (Direct Income Support, Resource Conservation):** While not framed purely under the "doubling income" initiative, the article mentions government efforts towards direct income support schemes (implemented by some states and the Centre) and incentives for resource conservation (e.g., 'paani bachao, paise kamao' in Punjab, promoting micro-irrigation).
    *   **Performance:** Direct income support is presented as less distorting and more effective in reaching farmers than input subsidies (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 33). Schemes like Punjab's water-saving incentive directly pay farmers for conserving resources, aligning income incentives with sustainable practices (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 33). The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana promotes micro-irrigation with the goal of 'per drop, more crop', aimed at improving productivity and thus potentially income (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 33). However, the article does not provide a quantitative assessment of the *overall* performance of these initiatives specifically in achieving the broad goal of doubling farmers' income across the country. It implies that challenges in policy implementation, resource constraints, and the need for further reforms (e.g., land lease markets, R&D investment) remain crucial for significantly improving farmers' economic well-being (Gulati & Juneja, 2022, p. 19, 34).
