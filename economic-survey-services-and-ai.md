### **33. Illustrate the performance of the Service sector in India in respect of the contribution in GVA, export, and employment. Evaluate the recent strategies for improvement of logistic services in India. (5+5)**

**(a) Performance of the Service Sector in India (GVA, Export, Employment) (5 Marks):**
The service sector remains a cornerstone of the Indian economy, demonstrating robust performance across several key indicators:

1.  **Contribution to Gross Value Added (GVA):**
    The services sector has been the "steadiest contributor to the gross value added (GVA) in the economy" (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 221, para 8.4). Its contribution to total GVA at current prices increased from 50.6% in FY14 to approximately 55% in FY25 (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 221, para 8.4, Chart VIII.4). The growth in the sector, measured by YoY change in real GVA, has been above 6% in each year of the last decade, except during the COVID-19 pandemic in FY21. The average services growth rate, which was 8% pre-pandemic, has risen to 8.3% in the post-pandemic period (FY23-FY25) (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 221, para 8.5).

2.  **Contribution to Exports:**
    India's share in global services exports has been steadily rising over the last two decades, reaching 4.3% in 2023, ranking India seventh globally (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 220, para 8.3, Chart VIII.2). The export of services grew at a trend rate of 11% during FY14 to FY23 at constant prices. Computer services and business services are dominant, accounting for around 70% of India's services exports (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 222, para 8.9). In April-November FY25, services export growth accelerated to 12.8%, up from 5.7% in the same period of FY24 (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 222, para 8.9). Services exports as a per cent of services GVA (net of public administration) reached 22.0% in FY23 (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 223, Chart VIII.6).

3.  **Contribution to Employment:**
    The services sector provides employment to approximately 30% of the workforce in India (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 221, para 8.4). While it is a significant employer, its employment share is not as high as its GVA contribution, indicating higher labour productivity in this sector compared to others. The NITI Aayog analysis (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 224, Chart VIII.8) further illustrates varied employment shares across sub-sectors, with Trade & Repair having a large employment bubble relative to its GVA share.

**(b) Evaluation of Recent Strategies for Improvement of Logistic Services in India (5 Marks):**
India has implemented a multi-pronged strategy to enhance its logistic services, aiming for greater efficiency, reduced costs, and improved connectivity. These strategies focus on modernizing infrastructure, leveraging technology, and fostering integration across various modes of transport.

1.  **Modernization and Digitization of Railways:**
    Indian Railways is undergoing significant upgrades. Initiatives include providing train indication boards, coach guidance systems, digital clocks, and Wi-Fi at stations. A new mobile catering policy has been introduced, and E-ticketing has reached 86% in the reserved sector, with faster refund processes and QR code-based payments (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 226, paras 8.13-8.14). These aim to enhance passenger experience and operational efficiency. The development of Bharat Gaurav tourist circuit trains also leverages railway infrastructure for tourism (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 227, para 8.15).

2.  **Enhancing Road Transport and Safety:**
    Road transport, the largest GVA generator within transport services, has seen a shift to digitized tolling via FASTag, significantly reducing waiting times (from 734 to 47 seconds). The government targets barrier-free tolling by FY29 and plans over a thousand wayside amenities. A comprehensive road safety strategy includes cashless treatment for accident victims and improved driver training (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 227, paras 8.16-8.17). These initiatives are geared towards user convenience, efficiency, and improved safety standards.

3.  **Boosting Aviation Infrastructure and New Segments:**
    As the fastest-growing aviation market, India is seeing substantial aircraft orders. The government is promoting the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) industry and developing new segments like drones and aircraft leasing (GIFT-IFSC) (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 228, Box VIII.2). The PM Gati Shakti initiative is integrating aviation with other transport modes, aiming for seamless multimodal connectivity (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 228, para 8.20).

4.  **Strengthening Ports, Waterways, and Shipping:**
    Major ports are enhancing capacity to meet trade demands. The Maritime India Vision 2030 and Amritkaal Vision 2047 aim to position India among the top five globally in shipbuilding and repair by 2047. Inland water transport is being developed, with 26 operational waterways, and efforts are underway to promote river cruise tourism (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 229, paras 8.21-8.23). These focus on expanding trade handling capabilities and utilizing untapped potential of waterways.

5.  **Leveraging Digital Platforms for Logistics:**
    The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is integrating hyperlocal and inter-city logistics service providers to create a seamless supply chain with unified first-mile, middle-mile, and last-mile connectivity across numerous cities. This "Logistics as a service" model within ONDC aims to democratize and improve logistics efficiency (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 236, Box VIII.5).

**Overall Evaluation:** These strategies represent a concerted effort to modernize India's logistics ecosystem. The focus on digitization, infrastructure development, multimodal integration (PM Gati Shakti), and fostering new segments (MRO, drones) is critical for reducing logistics costs, improving competitiveness, and supporting economic growth. The success of these initiatives will depend on sustained investment, effective implementation, and inter-agency coordination.

**(b) Change in Employment Scenario due to AI Adoption in Service Sub-sectors (6 Marks):**
The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to significantly alter the employment landscape in India's service sub-sectors, with impacts varying based on demand elasticities, skill requirements, and the nature of tasks.

1.  **General Principles of AI Impact:**
    AI is generally seen as a tool to augment human capabilities rather than a complete replacement (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 429, para 13.54). Education and skilling are critical for adapting the workforce. AI can automate routine tasks, freeing human workers for more complex, creative, and strategic roles, thereby raising skill requirements (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 429, para 13.55). The impact on employment often depends on the demand elasticity of the product/service; if demand is high and unmet, AI-augmented productivity can increase employment (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 430, para 13.58).

2.  **Sector-Specific Employment Changes based on Demand Elasticities (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 432, Chart XIII.1 & p. 433):**
    *   **Financial Services (High Elasticity: 1.86):** This sector is yet to reach market saturation. Productivity enhancements through AI are likely to be employment-generating. IT improvements, including AI, tend to raise employment by creating new roles and services.
    *   **Health and Social Work (High Elasticity: 1.3):** Automation, including AI in diagnostics, risk assessment, and health policy planning, can aid productivity and lead to employment gains. AI can maximize the effectiveness of frontline workers.
    *   **Retail and Wholesale Trade (High Elasticity: 1.2):** Given the large consumption base, AI-driven productivity gains (e.g., in customer preference identification, inventory management) are likely to make it profitable for new roles to co-exist with automated tasks.
    *   **Business Services (Elasticity: 1.08):** This export-oriented sector (IT/ITeS, R&D, legal, accounting) may see overall employment rise with AI. However, impacts could differ: lower value-added sub-sectors (like BPO) might see negative employment effects from automation, while higher value-added sub-sectors (like Global Capability Centers) focusing on innovation and complex tasks could see employment growth.
    *   **Education (Inelastic Demand: 0.77):** Theoretically, AI-based learning models could reduce demand for teachers. However, the essential nature of education and its high degree of regulation are likely to act as buffers, ensuring productivity improvements do not come at the expense of teacher employment, though roles might evolve.
    *   **Post and Telecom (Low Elasticity: 0.32):** This sector has high market saturation and an oligopolistic structure. Increased labour productivity via AI might lead to higher profit margins rather than lower prices or significantly new services. Automation may therefore act more as a labour-displacing force than a labour-augmenting one in this sector.

3.  **The Reinstatement Effect and Augmented Intelligence:**
    In sufficiently demand-elastic markets, the "reinstatement effect" (where new tasks and roles emerge due to technological advancements) can counterbalance displacement effects (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 433, para 13.59). The future of work is likely to involve "Augmented Intelligence," where AI expands the workforce's capabilities, improving efficiency and creating new opportunities (Economic Survey 2024-25, p. 434, para 13.60).

In summary, AI adoption will necessitate a shift towards higher-order skills like critical thinking, creativity, and complex problem-solving. Sectors with high demand elasticity are more likely to see employment gains or transformation of roles, while those with low elasticity and market saturation might face net displacement if new service demands are not generated. Proactive skilling and education reforms are crucial for navigating this transition.
