### **25. What are the labour codes recently proposed by the central government of India? State the salient features of The Industrial Relations Code, 2020. Briefly discuss the implications of these codes for women workers (1+4+5)**

**(a) Recently Proposed Labour Codes (1 mark):**
According to Sarkar and Samantroy (2023), the central government of India has enacted four new labour codes by amalgamating 29 existing labour legislations. These are:
1.  The Code on Wages, 2019
2.  The Industrial Relations Code, 2020
3.  The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020
4.  The Code on Social Security, 2020

**(b) Salient Features of The Industrial Relations Code, 2020 (4 marks):**
The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, subsumes three existing legislations: the Trade Union Act 1926, the Industrial Employment Standing Order Act 1946, and the Industrial Dispute Act 1947 (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6). While the article primarily focuses on the implications for women, it highlights certain features relevant to the broader framework:
*   **Subsumption of Acts:** It consolidates the key laws governing trade unions, conditions of employment, and the resolution of industrial disputes.
*   **Gender Neutrality (stated):** The code's provisions regarding trade union formation and functions are viewed as gender-neutral (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).
*   **Absence of Special Provisions for Women:** The article notes that despite aiming for gender neutrality, the code does not include any special provisions specifically for women employees (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).
*   **Trade Union Representation:** The authors argue that considering the low representation of women in trade union executive committees, the code *should have stipulated* a minimum threshold representation for women in the executive body of trade unions to ensure issues specific to women workers are prioritised (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).

**(c) Implications of the New Codes for Women Workers (5 marks):**
Sarkar and Samantroy (2023) examine the probable impact of the four new labour codes on women workers, particularly in the context of the declining female labour force participation rate. The implications are mixed, with some potential benefits and significant omissions:
*   **Positive Aspects:**
    *   **Retention of Key Provisions:** The new codes have broadly retained existing provisions beneficial to women, such as those against gender discrimination in wage payment (carried over from the Equal Remuneration Act 1976 into the Code on Wages, 2019) and enhanced maternity benefits (from the amended MBA 1961 into the Code on Social Security, 2020) (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 4).
    *   **Representation in Advisory Boards:** The Code on Wages stipulates that at least one-third of members in the Central and State Advisory Boards shall be women, which can help raise issues specific to women workers and influence minimum wage determination (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 4).
    *   **Extended Maternity Benefits and Creche Facilities:** The Code on Social Security retains and enhances maternity leave to 26 weeks and mandates creche facilities for establishments with 50 or more female employees. The OSHWC Code also facilitates common creche facilities for clusters of small industries (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 4, 6).
    *   **Inclusion of Unorganised, Gig, and Platform Workers:** The Code on Social Security extends the definition of "unorganised worker" to include home-based and self-employed workers (majority of whom are women) and includes gig and platform workers under the social security purview, potentially extending some benefits (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 5, 6).
    *   **Provision for Night Work:** The OSHWC Code includes a special provision enabling consenting women to work beyond 7:00 pm and before 6:00 am, subject to employer compliance with safety and other conditions (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).
*   **Areas of Omission/Concern:**
    *   **Exclusion of Informal Sector:** A major criticism is that despite intentions, a large number of women workers, particularly those in the informal sector (constituting over 91% of female employment), remain outside the protective purview of several key provisions due to applicability thresholds (e.g., 10 workers for OSHWC Code and institutional maternity benefit) (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 3, 5, 6).
    *   **Lack of Specific Provisions:** Despite being framed in the context of falling FLFPR, the codes lack comprehensive measures explicitly designed to facilitate greater female participation, beyond retaining existing benefits.
    *   **Discriminatory Wage Calculation:** The existing gender-discriminatory practice in calculating minimum wages based on a standard family unit with lower consumption units for female adults remains unaddressed (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 4).
    *   **Compliance Burden:** Digital compliance for schemes (like for construction workers' welfare boards) can be difficult for semi-literate informal sector women workers (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 5).
    *   **Limited Definition of Family:** The definition of 'family' in the Social Security Code is restrictive, primarily based on blood relations and the idea of a married working woman, excluding other dependents like foster parents or childless senior citizens (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).
    *   **No Minimum Representation in Trade Unions:** As noted above, the lack of mandatory minimum representation for women in trade union leadership is seen as a missed opportunity (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).
    *   **Challenges with Night Work Provision:** The night work provision, while enabling, might disincentivise smaller employers due to the cost of arranging transport facilities (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).

Overall, the codes represent a consolidation and some improvements but fail to comprehensively address the systemic issues faced by the vast majority of women workers in the informal sector, which is crucial for reversing the trend of falling FLFPR (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, The Way Forward).

### **26. State the salient features of the Code on Social Security, 2020. Discuss the implication of this code in the context of falling female labour force participation in India (5+5)**

**(a) Salient Features of the Code on Social Security, 2020 (5 marks):**
According to Sarkar and Samantroy (2023), the Code on Social Security, 2020, is a significant piece of legislation that aims to universalize social security coverage by amalgamating nine existing social security laws, including the Unorganised Workers Social Security Act (UWSSA) 2008. Its salient features include:
*   **Universalisation Goal:** Aims to extend social security benefits to all employees, whether in the formal or informal sector (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 3).
*   **Subsumed Legislations:** Consolidates acts related to employees' provident fund, gratuity, employees' state insurance, maternity benefit, employees' compensation, and social security for unorganised workers.
*   **Inclusion of New Worker Categories:** Extends the scope to include gig workers and platform workers under the social security framework, alongside unorganised workers (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).
*   **Maternity Benefit:** Subsumes the Maternity Benefit Act (MBA) 1961 and retains its key provisions, including enhanced maternity leave entitlement of 26 weeks (for the first two children) and mandatory creche facilities for establishments with 50 or more female employees (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 4).
*   **Definition of Worker/Employee:** The code attempts to provide comprehensive definitions, although the article notes concerns about multiplicity and potential confusion (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 3). The definition of "unorganised worker" includes home-based and self-employed workers (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).
*   **Definition of Family:** Expands the definition of 'family' to include dependent parents and in-laws, a perceived improvement towards incorporating social security for family members (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).
*   **Applicability Thresholds:** While aiming for universalization, the applicability of specific provisions often retains establishment-based thresholds, notably for establishments having 10 or more workers (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 3, 5).

**(b) Implication of the Code on Social Security in the Context of Falling FLFPR (5 marks):**
The Code on Social Security, 2020, has significant implications for addressing the issue of falling female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) in India, though its effectiveness is limited by certain factors discussed by Sarkar and Samantroy (2023):
*   **Addressing Lack of Social Security:** The article highlights that one reason for low FLFPR is the lack of employment protection and social security, particularly in the informal sector where most women work (over 91%) (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 2, 3). The Code's stated aim of universalizing social security and including unorganised, gig, and platform workers is a positive step towards addressing this gap and potentially encouraging women to participate in the formal labour market.
*   **Maternity Benefits as Enabler:** The enhanced maternity leave and mandatory creche facilities are crucial enablers for women to balance work and family responsibilities, which is a major constraint cited in the literature for women's low participation and retention (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 2, 4). Making these benefits more accessible can reduce the disincentive for women and employers.
*   **Coverage Limitations due to Thresholds:** A significant limitation is that the key institutional maternity benefit and other provisions often apply only to establishments with 10 or more workers (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 3, 5). This excludes the vast majority of women in the informal sector who work in smaller establishments or are self-employed/home-based workers, leaving them without this critical support. While unorganised workers are included in principle, the article notes that institutional maternity benefit is effectively limited to organised sector women employees, with informal workers only potentially getting lump-sum payments not linked to wages (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 5).
*   **Exclusion of Domestic Workers:** The article points out that despite the UWSSA aiming to cover all unorganised workers, domestic workers are still not explicitly included, representing a significant omission for a large segment of the female informal workforce (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 3).
*   **Compliance Hurdles:** The process to avail benefits under schemes for unorganised workers can be complex (e.g., registration, certification, digital submission), posing a challenge for semi-literate women workers (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 5).

In conclusion, while the Code on Social Security represents a commendable effort towards universalization and includes important provisions like enhanced maternity benefits, its effectiveness in significantly boosting FLFPR is limited by the exclusion of a large segment of the informal sector workforce (where most women are concentrated) due to applicability thresholds and procedural complexities (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 5, The Way Forward).

### **27. Discuss the salient features of the new labour codes in India. (10)**

Based on the analysis by Sarkar and Samantroy (2023), the four new labour codes (The Code on Wages, 2019; The Industrial Relations Code, 2020; The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020; and The Code on Social Security, 2020) represent a major reform aimed at rationalizing and consolidating 29 existing labour laws in India. Their salient features, particularly as they relate to the context of women workers and labour market dynamics, are:

*   **Consolidation and Simplification:** A primary objective is to simplify the complex web of existing labour legislations by subsuming them into four broader codes. This is intended to facilitate the ease of doing business and potentially improve compliance (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 1).
*   **Revised Wage Determination:** The Code on Wages, 2019, consolidates laws related to wages, including minimum wages, payment of wages, bonus, and equal remuneration. It aims to provide a national floor wage and simplify the minimum wage fixing mechanism. Notably, it incorporates the principle of equal pay for similar work from the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 4). However, the authors highlight that the codes fail to rectify the inherent gender discrimination in the calculation of minimum wages based on calorie norms for a standard family unit (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 4).
*   **Changes in Industrial Relations:** The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, governs trade unions, conditions of employment, and dispute resolution. While framed as gender-neutral, the authors point out the absence of specific provisions for women employees and the missed opportunity to mandate minimum representation for women in trade union leadership, crucial for voicing women's specific concerns (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).
*   **Occupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions:** The OSHWC Code, 2020, deals with the safety, health, and working conditions of workers. It includes provisions for working hours, leave, and workplace safety. A significant feature is the special provision allowing consenting women to work night shifts, subject to safety and other conditions provided by the employer (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6). The code also addresses creche facilities, including provisions for common creches in industrial clusters, and requirements for separate sanitation facilities (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).
*   **Expansion of Social Security Coverage:** The Code on Social Security, 2020, is perhaps the most ambitious, aiming to extend social security benefits (like provident fund, ESI, gratuity, maternity benefit) to all workers. Crucially, it brings unorganised workers (including home-based and self-employed), gig workers, and platform workers under the social security umbrella (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 3, 6). It retains and enhances maternity benefits from the previous act (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 4).
*   **Applicability Thresholds and Exclusions:** A major criticism highlighted in the article is that despite the stated goals of universalization and inclusion, many provisions, particularly related to institutional social security benefits and OSHWC standards, retain thresholds based on the number of workers in an establishment (e.g., 10 or more). This effectively excludes a large majority of informal sector workers, where women are concentrated (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 3, 5, 6). Specific groups like domestic workers are also noted as being potentially excluded from full coverage (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 3).
*   **Redefined Concepts:** The codes redefine certain terms like "unorganised worker" and "family," broadening their scope in some aspects (e.g., family including in-laws) but remaining restrictive in others (e.g., definition of family tied to a married working woman, excluding other dependents) (Sarkar and Samantroy, 2023, p. 6).

In summary, the new codes consolidate existing laws and introduce some progressive elements like expanded social security categories and provisions for night work and creches. However, as argued by Sarkar and Samantroy (2023), their effectiveness in addressing the specific challenges faced by the majority of women workers, particularly in the informal sector, is limited by retained applicability thresholds, failure to address discriminatory wage calculation, and lack of specific provisions promoting women's representation in labour institutions.
