### **23. Illustrate the missing middle problem in the Indian manufacturing sector. Do you think this problem as an institutional problem? Justify your answer. (4+6)**

**(a) Illustration of the Missing Middle Problem (4 marks):**
Based on Raj and Sen (2020), the "missing middle" problem in the Indian manufacturing sector refers to the relative scarcity of mid-size firms compared to a large number of small, informal, unproductive firms and a smaller number of large, formal, productive firms. The authors illustrate this using a combined dataset of informal and formal manufacturing firms:
*   **Size Distribution:** Figure 1 in the article, which shows the share of employment by firm size categories, reveals a "dualistic structure" and a "bipolar" size distribution. There are two prominent peaks or "modes": one on the left representing small firms (6-9 and 10-49 workers) and one on the right for large firms (500+ workers). A significant "trench" is observed in the intermediate size categories (50-499 workers), indicating a low share of employment in these mid-size firms. The article notes that almost 75% of the workforce is concentrated in the smallest and largest categories, with only the remaining 25% in the intermediate sizes (Raj and Sen, 2020, p. 52).
*   **Productivity Gap:** Figure 2 highlights the substantial economic distance between small and large firms in terms of labour productivity. Firms in the 500+ category were about 13 times more productive than firms in the 6-9 size category in 2010-11, and this productivity gap widened over the period between 2000-01 and 2010-11 (Raj and Sen, 2020, p. 52). The lack of growth among small firms to reach mid-size status, which would increase their productivity and contribution to the economy, is a core aspect of this problem.

**(b) The Missing Middle as an Institutional Problem (6 marks):**
Yes, Raj and Sen (2020) strongly argue that the missing middle problem in India's manufacturing sector is fundamentally an *institutional problem*. They justify this stance by analyzing how various institutional constraints differentially affect firms of different sizes.
*   **Differential Impact of Institutions:** The article's core finding is that certain types of institutional constraints are more binding for mid-size firms compared to both smaller and larger firms. While some constraints like high taxes, access to finance, and basic infrastructure issues (power, telecommunications, skilled labour) affect firms of all sizes significantly, these do not explain why the *middle* is specifically missing or constrained more than the extremes (Raj and Sen, 2020, Empirical Analysis).
*   **"Predatory Institutions" and Corruption:** The authors identify "predatory institutions"—particularly corruption and the day-to-day interactions mid-size firms have with the state—as the most important institutional constraint driving the missing middle problem. Their descriptive analysis (Figure 6) shows a hump-shaped relationship, indicating corruption is a more serious impediment for mid-size firms than for small or large firms. While their regression analysis on the perception of corruption as an obstacle found it significant for most categories except the very largest, the qualitative and descriptive evidence points towards corruption being particularly binding for firms attempting to transition into or operate within the mid-size range (Raj and Sen, 2020, Perceived Obstacles, Empirical Analysis, Conclusions). This suggests that the costs and complexities associated with navigating corrupt bureaucratic processes disproportionately hinder the growth of firms in this size category.
*   **Labour Regulations, Permits, and Licensing:** The empirical analysis also finds that labour regulations, business licensing, and operating permits are statistically significantly more likely to constrain firms in the 10-49 and 50-99 worker categories compared to smaller and larger firms (Raj and Sen, 2020, Empirical Analysis, Table 2). These are specific institutional/regulatory hurdles that appear to pose a higher relative burden on mid-size firms.
*   **Contrast with other factors:** By showing that issues like crime, overdue payments, or access to the legal system are either equally constraining across sizes or more so for larger firms, and that infrastructure/finance affect all equally, the authors strengthen their argument that the *specific* institutional barriers related to corruption and certain regulatory compliance costs (like licenses and labour laws) are the key institutional determinants uniquely affecting the missing middle.

Thus, the problem is framed not merely as a lack of finance or infrastructure, but as one where the institutional environment, particularly corrupted interactions with the state and complex regulations, creates disproportionate hurdles for firms seeking to grow into or operate at a mid-size scale (Raj and Sen, 2020, Conclusions).

### **24. Discuss the key institutional determinants of the evolutions and persistence of the missing middle in the Indian manufacturing sector. Do you think the current policy approach for accelerating the manufacturing sector enough to address the missing middle problem? (6+4)**

**(a) Key Institutional Determinants of the Missing Middle (6 marks):**
Based on the analysis by Raj and Sen (2020), the evolution and persistence of the missing middle in the Indian manufacturing sector are primarily driven by specific institutional determinants that disproportionately constrain mid-size firms. The key determinants identified are:
*   **"Predatory Institutions" and Corruption:** The most significant institutional constraint, according to the authors, is the prevalence of corruption and the day-to-day interactions mid-size firms face with lower-level bureaucrats. The study's findings suggest that corruption acts as a more serious obstacle for firms in the middle-size categories compared to both very small and very large firms (Raj and Sen, 2020, Perceived Obstacles, Conclusions). This includes instances where informal gifts or payments are expected or requested for obtaining basic services, permits, or licences (as illustrated by the hump-shaped pattern in Figure 6, although empirical significance varied by specific graft type). This "petty corruption" at the implementation level by bureaucratic institutions increases the transaction costs and risks associated with formalization and growth, effectively disincentivizing firms from scaling up into the mid-size segment.
*   **Labour Regulations, Permits, and Licensing Laws:** The study also finds that specific regulatory requirements, such as labour regulations and obtaining business permits and licenses, are perceived as significantly more constraining for firms in the 10-49 and 50-99 worker categories compared to their smaller and larger counterparts (Raj and Sen, 2020, Empirical Analysis, Table 2). These regulations often involve complex procedures and compliance costs that can be particularly burdensome for firms transitioning from a small, informal structure to a more formal, mid-size operation, potentially acting as a barrier to growth beyond a certain threshold.

While other institutional dimensions like infrastructure quality, access to finance, and taxes are significant constraints for firms in India, the analysis indicates that these often affect firms of all sizes more equally or are more binding for large firms (e.g., the legal system, inspections). Therefore, the authors pinpoint corruption (especially petty corruption and predatory interactions) and specific regulatory hurdles (labour, permits, licensing) as the critical institutional determinants that specifically inhibit the growth and persistence of mid-size firms (Raj and Sen, 2020, Conclusions).

**(b) Adequacy of Current Policy Approach (4 marks):**
Raj and Sen (2020) argue that the current policy approach in India, which focuses on improving the general "ease of doing business" by reforming regulatory institutions, is *not* sufficient to fully address the missing middle problem.
*   **Focus of Current Policy:** The authors note that current government policy places significant emphasis on easing the constraints of doing business in India, often targeting regulatory reforms at a broader level (Raj and Sen, 2020, Introduction).
*   **Authors' Critique:** Their findings suggest that the missing middle is constrained not just by high-level regulations, but critically by the implementation level and the "predatory" behaviour of *lower-level bureaucrats* engaged in petty corruption during day-to-day interactions with firms (Raj and Sen, 2020, Introduction, Conclusions). While reforming formal regulations is necessary, it may not effectively tackle the informal, corrupt practices faced by growing firms.
*   **Recommended Action:** To solve the missing middle problem, the authors propose that more attention needs to be given to disciplining these lower-level bureaucrats and making government procedures more transparent and accountable to reduce the scope for corruption. This suggests that broader regulatory reforms must be complemented by targeted efforts to improve the integrity and accountability of the bureaucratic implementation machinery to remove the specific institutional impediments faced by mid-size firms (Raj and Sen, 2020, Introduction, Conclusions). Therefore, the current policy focusing on general ease of doing business is seen as necessary but not exhaustive enough to address the specific institutional dynamics hindering the missing middle.
